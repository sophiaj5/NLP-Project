2023-09-12 15:23:39,The Future of r/Fitness - Update,"Howdy. [A few months back](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/14ctakj/the_future_of_rfitness/) we shared some details on how r/Fitness and the moderation thereof was affected (negatively) by the loss of third party mobile apps, such as Apollo, caused by Reddit's changes to its API. Specifically, that r/Fitness would be placed into Restricted mode - which does not allow posts, only comments - while we got a plan in place to address the significant loss of effective tools for moderation.

Since we're going on three months from that, I felt it was time to share an update on where we're at. The ""tentative plan"" that was mentioned in our first post involved me (formerly u/purplespengler) rebuilding a bunch of the moderation tools that I'd created in the past for r/Fitness and other fitness/lifting subs. This is unfortunately slow going, as I have a full time job and family that take priority for my time, the tools I'm building are pretty robust, I'm writing them from the ground up, and I also have infrastructure to run them on that needs to be set up. That being said, the work has been progressing steadily and the good news is that it should be done within the next few weeks. Once those tools are up and running, it will allow us to take r/Fitness out of Restricted mode so that posts can be made again. In addition, we're going to have some powerful, more targeted ways of detecting and blocking spammers and other bad actors, which should allow us to generally loosen some of the restrictions on who can post or comment, and where.

Thanks for bearing with us while we work to compensate for the loss of tooling that Reddit dumped on us.",Fitness,"The Future of r/Fitness - Update-Howdy.

2023-07-26 20:56:34,Stronger by Science - Effective Strength Training for the Time-Poor,"#[Article Here](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/training-for-time-poor/)

Training with time restrictions is a very common problem that people come to Fittit needing help with, so this article that SBS put up recently deserves a highlight.

This isn't as long or as dense as average SBS content, so you should really read the whole thing, but if you're lazy (be honest) or time-poor (heyo), here's the summary of points from the article:

- Taking up to a week off from training is unlikely to impact your maximal strength. Such situations can be used as a chance to rest and recover; there’s no need to worry about losing strength.
- To maintain strength, high intensity, very low volume approaches (e.g., only a few heavy, 9-9.5 RPE singles across the training week) or significantly reduced training volumes (e.g., by 50%) can be effective strategies for at least a couple of months.
- For a minimal effective training dose for improving maximal strength, a handful of working sets of 1-5 repetitions on the major lifts per week, using RPEs from 7.5-9.5 should be sufficient. If time allows, you could also add in a little accessory work.
- Other strategies can also be used to improve your training efficiency. Consider shorter more specific warm-ups, timing your rest periods, choosing “bang for buck” exercises, and incorporating supersets or circuits.",Fitness,"Stronger by Science - Effective Strength Training for the Time-Poor-#[Article Here](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/training-for-time-poor/)

2023-06-18 19:49:16,The Future of r/Fitness,"Howdy!

You may have noticed that r/Fitness was closed for a bit. For the moment, it is back open but restricted.

Initially, we closed as part of a recent large protest across Reddit that you may or may not have heard of, with the goal of pressuring Reddit into reworking the upcoming changes to its API. There have been approximately seven thousand news articles and posts about this, so we're not going to rehash all of it here because - let's be real - you probably don't care very much. But we do feel an explanation is owed for where we were at with it, hence this post.

While it's unfortunate that taking the sub private can negatively impact those seeking help from community, we felt it was ultimately fine because unlike most subreddits, we have a Wiki - which, realistically, answers over 90% of questions people come here with - which is hosted externally, and would be unaffected.

Thousands of subreddits participated in this protest, each of them having their own reasons. For our part, we had two:

1. Reddit initially stated they would be removing any and all ability to see NSFW content from the API. While this may not seem like a big deal, it really, really is. The API is what every moderation bot and many moderation tools use to interact with Reddit. Removal of NSFW content from visibility by those tools would absolutely cripple mods' ability to quickly identify bad actors to keep them out of their communities. For instance, spammer accounts could flag their user page as NSFW, and hide 100% of their posts and comments from moderation tools, requiring manual evaluation instead, which thanks to our second reason would require an unreasonable amount of time and effort.
2. Reddit has historically been extremely bad at creating effective, user friendly, usable moderation tools - especially for moderators on mobile platforms. The mobile site and app are not built for moderation at all, with some uses cases and features being flat out unusable. For this reason, a significant portion of our mod team has relied on the third party app Apollo to be able to moderate. Apollo has become the most prominent victim of Reddit's punitive API pricing, and very soon it will be gone forever.

Late in the week it became clear that Reddit was not going to budge, and the full removal of NSFW content from the API was walked back for accounts that are moderators. We had no reason left to participate in the protest except ""Fuck you"", which is a good enough reason for some mod teams, but not for ours, especially since that ""fuck you"" would unfairly extend to our users. Facing this, we decided to continue to keep it private for only a few more days to give us time and space to figure out how we were going to move forward once the moderation tools we rely on disappear. We have mods across several time zones and continents, so coordinating our discussions about this can take time.

While we have a tentative plan, it's going to take some time to realize, and since we no longer have any defensible reasons to do so, it's not reasonable to continue to keep r/Fitness totally closed off in the meantime. We feel a good middle ground that balances giving people access to the fitness information they want without letting everything go off the rails because of the loss of tools is to reopen the sub in restricted mode. When we have a solution in place that allows us to continue moderating effectively, we will go back to how things were before the protesting started.

\---

Some of you are reading this and thinking, *""Why should I care about you jannies getting your janny panties in a twist because Reddit makes it harder for you to janny my free speech for free and janny janny janny lol they do it for free?""*

The answer to that question is one you can choose to believe, or not, but laughing at salty contrarians aside we're sincere here:

All of us on the mod team choose to be mods of r/Fitness (and occasionally other fitness subs too) because fitness and helping people with it is something we're passionate about. Most of us have been around internet fitness spaces long enough to remember the insane Wild West it was only 10 years ago, and even worse as you go back further. Most of us remember what it was like to struggle to find legitimate/trustworthy answers, or have nowhere to look at all. And for all of us, what we do here is about helping the community have a better experience and get better information than we did when we first started pursuing our fitness goals.

The internet is full of spammers, and the fitness space is full of salesmen, phonies, and bullshit. The most consistent thing we've seen over the years from people who come here is that they feel r/Fitness offers something of a barrier to all that, and that barrier comes from active - sometimes aggressive - moderation, by way of removals and bans. This is by far the majority of the actions we take as mods, and it's also the most invisible because when it's done right nobody ever smells the poop before it gets flushed down the toilet.

That is why it matters when Reddit makes it harder for us to keep moderating, and that is how it can impact you, who just want to find what you need to achieve your fitness goals and don't care about third party apps or APIs - It becomes harder to maintain the barrier that keeps most of the shitheads away from you. If having that barrier is something you appreciate, then hopefully you can understand why we participated in the protest by taking the sub dark briefly. It was not for us, it was for you, which is why we've reopened now - There's no more possibility of staying closed being valuable.",Fitness,"The Future of r/Fitness-Howdy!

He said that training 5 to 6 days a week works mainly for bodybuilders taking PED’s and training, less often, taking the muscle to failure was more effective for a natural bodybuilder.

2023-05-31 16:00:58,Nuckols: How do exercise volume and intensity impact longevity?,"Greg Nuckols of Stronger by Science provided a wonderful review of a long-term study on exercise intensity and mortality. Read the entire thing here: https://www.strongerbyscience.com/exercise-longevity/

To give an idea on the raw amount of data points here, here’s a bit of Greg’s description of study design: 

>> So, a recent study by Lee and colleagues helps fill the gap. The study was based on data collected in the Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study – two long-term prospective cohort studies, containing detailed data on about 116,000 subjects. In both studies, participants were asked about their exercise habits every two years, starting in 1986. Since both studies are so long-running, almost 48,000 participants have died since the start of the studies. Obviously, lots of deaths are unfortunate in a general sense. However, when you’re trying to estimate how some variable impacts mortality rates, lots of deaths are a good thing – it’s hard to estimate how something affects your risk of dying if very few people actually die. In short, this was a very well-designed study for quantifying the associations between mortality and moderate and vigorous exercise volumes.

And here are his takeaways:

>> If you don’t have much time to exercise, vigorous-intensity exercise is probably your best bet. 2-3 hours per week of vigorous-intensity exercise is associated with larger reductions in mortality than 2-3 hours of moderate-intensity exercise.

>> If you do a moderate amount of exercise each week (around 5 hours), it doesn’t really seem to matter how you allocate it. 5 hours of vigorous-intensity exercise is great. 5 hours of moderate-intensity exercise is great. 2.5 hours of each is great. You really can’t go wrong.

>> If you exercise a lot, and you’re specifically trying to minimize mortality risk, it probably makes the most sense to focus on doing more moderate-intensity exercise after knocking out 2-3 hours of vigorous-intensity exercise per week.

>> More exercise is generally a good thing. I’m sure I’m preaching to the choir when I say that, but it always bears repeating.

>> For reducing your risk for specific cardiovascular diseases, it’s probably worth making a point of doing at least 2-3 hours of vigorous-intensity exercise per week.",Fitness,"Nuckols: How do exercise volume and intensity impact longevity?-Greg Nuckols of Stronger by Science provided a wonderful review of a long-term study on exercise intensity and mortality.

>> For reducing your risk for specific cardiovascular diseases, it’s probably worth making a point of doing at least 2-3 hours of vigorous-intensity exercise per week."

Trying to trim down and burn off some body fat. I’m muscular from a couple years of training strength, and understand that more muscle mass yields greater BMR and therefore better passive calorie burn. 

I’ve recently been seeing a lot of success from steady-state cardio and positive dietary changes, but I’m trying to lose fat in the most efficient way possible and wanted to ask the community. I have been going to the gym for 2-hour sessions 3-4 times a week, the first hour is steady-state, and then after a brief rest period for rehydrating, I start weight training for another 45-60 minutes. 

Is this the most efficient way possible? Would it serve me better to spend more time on steady-state and then tackle weight training when I’m leaner? Is there any interference effect from doing low to moderate intensity cardio and then straight into weightlifting?

As long as I'm lifting same weight X, how much does it change how it's split across reps?

Source: Frawley et al (2018). Those who fasted for 10 hrs before lifting had a lower respiratory exchange ratio (RER) for back squat and military press than those who ate 15 minutes before lifting. A lower RER means increased reliance on fat oxidation as a fuel source. 

A couple limitations in this study:

1. The sample consisted of NCAA D1 athletes which may not be a representative sample. 

2. RER was not measured post-lifting. The study argues that since fat metabolism is relied upon greater while lifting and since fat metabolism is known to be greater after aerobic exercise done during a fast, then it’s likely to be similarly greater after lifting during a fast. This argument seems based on conjecture though and not very compelling.",Fitness,"Fasting before lifting to maximize fat loss?-I am seeing some conflicting views about whether or not fasting before lifting is recommended.

2023-05-15 15:45:40,"Program Review: Jamie Lewis' Updated ""Feast Famine and Ferocity"": I am the leanest and strongest i've ever been","**INTRO**

If you’re not a fan of Jamie Lewis, originally of “Chaos and Pain” and now “Plague of Strength”, you’re not going to enjoy this piece, but I’m going to lead by saying Jamie has flat out changed my life all for the positive and I owe him a TON, and the least I can do is sing his praise, positively review his material and try to get others to buy from and support him.  So that’s what I’m going to do here.


Get the program here

https://plagueofstrength.com/the-feast-famine-and-ferocity-diet-is-now-updated-and-available-as-an-e-book/

I'm going to write this backwards, starting with the results, going into the program reviews, then the background.  I figure that's really what's important.

---

**STARTING WITH RESULTS**

* It’s so rare I do photos, [so appreciate this](https://i.imgur.com/uwkBgoj.png).  This isn’t 6 weeks purely on FFF, but the end of Super Squats and the final week of “Feast”, so about 9 weeks of change.  



* As far as lift results go, I genuinely hate detailing this stuff, since my training is so wild and difficult to track.  I’m gonna just shutgun some stuff here, but ultimately: I’m the strongest I’ve been in a LONG time while also the leanest.

*  From week 1 to week 4 of Feast, I went from only being able to do 3 rounds of EMOM 200lb log clean and press for doubles to getting through a full 8 rounds of it.

*  From 4 triples of SSB squats w/405 in the first week of Famine to 6 triples of 415 in the third week of Feast

*  4x2x321 axle bench in the first week of Famine, 10x2x301 in week 3 of Feast (with 1 minute rests vs 2+)

* But honestly, stuff like [this]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbtDWEWJ8wA) is really what I find most impressive as far as results.  That’s an 11+4+3x405+chain mat pull, but the context is: I had been walking around the zoo for 6 hours that day, having only had a Metabolic Drive shake for lunch and then coming home from a solid [carnivore feast](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/tnation/original/4X/e/1/d/e1d5ffdf73834fc67487531f81d2d921476cc598.jpeg), and I had 5 minutes before we were going to turn right around and walk the dog (get in my 2 miles).  I threw on some shorts I had on the laundry, warmed up with ONE rep of 155+chains, and then pulled that.  All the daily activity, new stuff I’ve been exposed to, good eating, etc etc has me fully healed and ready to move and act when needed.  I’ve genuinely just never felt more capable and dangerous.

**PROGRAM REVIEW**

*THE PROGRAMS IN GENERAL*

* I’m drawn to Jamie’s programming primarily because he doesn’t rely much on percentages and he encourages experimentation.  His programming is far more ideas and structures than an actual set routine, and the focus is on effort.  What was even more awesome about both Feast and Famine was that Jamie offers a 3-4 day variant and a 5-6 day variant of both programs, so there’s a LOT of flexibility there.  Those 3-4 day variants are LOADED to make it all work out, so, amazingly, I found myself drawn to the 5-6 day variants instead.  Since I get up early to train, I’m able to train 5 days a week without issue and didn’t need to cut down to 3-4 days, despite the fact I’ve written about the value of lifting weights 3-4 days a week to put on size.  It helps that, at this point in my training, putting on size wasn’t the concern: I had Super Squats for that.  For now, the goal was simply to experience the training and see what happened.

**AWESOME ELEMENTS OF FAMINE AND FEAST PROGRAMS**


* Both programs feature a day Jamie refers to as “Dealer’s Choice”, which is as it sounds: do what you want.  For Famine, it’s up to 90 minutes.  For Feast, there’s no set time and Jamie even permits you to make it a day off if needed (which, despite all the increased cals, you may still need: I’ll detail that more later).  Either way is brilliant, and I think EVERY program needs this.  Trainees are stupid.  I’m including myself in there.  Trainees will ALWAYS sneak stupid crap into a program.  Pet lifts (curls, of course), stupid human tricks and gimmicks, “weak areas”, etc.   Trainees will inevitably wreck a program because they’ll change it up too much to fit in all this extra stuff that they end up reducing the effectiveness or flat our violating the intent, turning accumulation into intensification or GPP.  By having ONE day of the program where you just do what you want, you can get it all out of your system and then get back on program.  It’s the “cheat meal” of training.  During Famine, I’d throw in ALL that extra stuff I was doing before: Poundstone curls, lateral raise deathsets, belt squats, Kroc Rows, mat pull ROM progression, etc.  During Feast, my schedule was nuttier, so I often would just continue the ROM progression cycle and, if I had time, throw in some conditioning work and call it good.  But in both cases: my program compliance was MUCH stronger compared to programs I’d run in the past.

* Daily physical requirements/daily work.  Prior to starting up the program, I had my own daily work, which was: 50 chins, 50 dips, 50 pull aparts, 40 reverse hypers, 30 GHRs, 20 standing ab wheels, and often some neck work.  I’d get this done no matter what.  Jamie prescribes a daily 2 mile walk, outside, no matter what, along with 300 squats and 300 push ups.  I balked when I first saw that…and, in turn, loved that I had a new challenge in front of me.  And yeah: the first 2 days, I was SORE AS HELL, but upon adapting, I saw some AMAZING results.  The push ups and squats have honestly been transformative, as I’m seeing veins all over my quads and shoulders, but honestly, that daily 2 mile walk outside has probably been one of the most positive things I’ve ever done for myself.  It’s a chance to clear my head, get in some vitamin D, and bring back some health into my life.  Having it be a daily requirement and forcing myself to come up with ways to fit the walk into my day has been awesome, and my dog is appreciating all the time outside as well, and it’s gotten me to break out my weight vest again to add in even more resistance opportunities.  And that 2 mile walk has become a mere minimum, as I find myself becoming “activity seeking”, and will often get in 2 miles unweighted walking and then an extra 1-2 miles with a weight vest on as well. 

* On the daily work, Jamie is adamant that “this is not part of your workout-it is part of being a human being”.  I appreciate the sentiment there.  Being able to move your body through space is huge.  That said, I was big on making the push ups and squats INTO a workout when possible.  Toward the end, my go to was to use Tabata intervals of 20 seconds on/10 seconds off and do squats during the 20 second and push ups during the 10.  I’d settle on 20 squats per round and 15 push ups, getting me 300 squats in 15 rounds, and then I’d do the remaining push ups as fast as possible.  Keeping to those Tabata intervals makes this a pretty solid conditioning hit and only takes about 9 minutes to knock out.  Typically, I’d do this after the workout on weekdays, and on weekends I took to accomplishing it literally as soon as my feet would hit the floor in the morning.  I HATE working out, still do, and getting this done ASAP was pretty big for me.  Sometimes, though, I’d get cute and start incorporating push ups and squats into a larger conditioning paradigm, like in a circuit with swings, or GHRs, or chins, etc.  But, either way, I always met these goals.

**DEVIATIONS I MADE TO BOTH PROGRAMS**

* Jamie encourages experimentation, so game on.

* Jamie slots that “Dealer’s choice” toward the middle of the week with both programs, but for my work schedule it worked better to put it on Fridays/Weekends.  In the case of Famine, his middle of the week workout is either a day off or a 30 minute bodyweight conditioning circuit, which fit MUCH better with my weekend schedule, so putting that on Sat/Sun and Dealer’s choice on Friday allowed me to get in a 60+ minute dealer’s choice workout, which got in a lot of work.  In the case of Feast, there are 5 loaded days of training that worked much better for M-F for me, and then dealer’s choice on weekends allowed me to get anywhere from a 4-60 minute workout, depending on what my choice was as the dealer.  

* I made sure to run a full week of both programs exactly as written out, to include rest times, exercise order, etc.  In doing so, many of my workouts ran into the 80+ minute mark, which became a bit cumbersome with my schedule, but I wanted to understand how the training “felt” before I mucked with it.  Once I had that baseline established, I broke out the giant sets, short rest times, etc: all those tricks I’ve used in the past to get in more volume in less time.  I still made sure to bring the intensity, but wherever I could find logical pairings and groupings, I’d throw them in.  The 5xAMRAP hanging leg raises that happen EVERY training day are a quick kill, and much of the arm work could work in with other stuff.  Sometimes, though, it’d become something incredibly brutal, like bouncing between heavy shrugs and squats during Feast (more on that later).

* You’ll note I did NOT write about additional conditioning work, extra workouts, etc etc.  Jamie really “fixed” my compulsion here.  I’d be done with the training…and I’d trained “enough”.  This was really pretty huge for me.

*”FAMINE” SPECIFIC OBSERVATIONS/DEVIATIONS*

* With Jamie’s permission, I took full workout footage of all my training sessions of Famine AND Feast, so I’ll post those if you want to see the whole thing in action.

* [Famine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VnicWt6NqU&list=PLfcuGAffLlSdfWeHmA6BsUctSrdGdaObB&pp=iAQB)

* [Feast: Playlist isn't fully updated, but the videos are all on my channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k8jkk6VLec&list=PLfcuGAffLlSf-y7VAbGZ3TVKoE1T5OycC&pp=iAQB)

* I made a few deviations from the programming, more out of equipment limitations.  I don’t have a leg extension or leg curl machine.  For extensions, I could use my reverse hyper, sit on top of it, hook my feet through the straps and do extensions.  That worked well.  Turning around to do curls that way?  Not as great.   I stuck with it through Famine, since it’s only 2 weeks, before eventually just going with GHRs during Feast, and when I return to Famine, that’s where I’ll go.

* My cable set up is pretty janky, so for cable rows I went with landmine t-bar rows instead.  I also don’t have a machine shoulder press, but I rigged up a VERY awesome Viking press set-up with bands that was clutch (you’ll see it on the video).

* Strongman implements regularly featured, because they’re awesome.  I also was making extensive use of the SSB, because I was still pretty broken from Super Squats.

* I didn’t follow the diet 100%, but I met the spirit of it.  LOTS of caffeine, shakes made up the majority of my nutrition, calories were low.  I trained fasted as well.  

*”FEAST” SPECIFIC OBSERVATIONS/DEVIATIONS*

* I underwent a MAJOR nutritional pivot during Feast, and it’s been one of the most positive things I’ve done for myself in a long time.  I absolutely didn’t meet Jamie’s prescription as far as calories goes, primarily because I’m not going to count calories.  In addition, the shakes were still regular features because they went a long way toward streamlining my life.  HOWEVER, for my solid meals: I went carnivore.  I’d been wanting to try out a carnivore diet for a few years now, after listening first to Shawn Baker and then Paul Saladino and a few other carnivore influencers talk to the approach (and constantly hearing Mark Bell beat the drum for it).  This also matches up a bit more directly with how Jamie laid out the “Apex Predator Diet”, as the solid meals were all meat.  I honestly just wasn’t in a good place psychologically to undertake it, but this protocol was VERY freeing in that regard, so I went full steam ahead…and it’s been amazing.  I’ll probably just have to make it another blog post (a continuation of the overhaul series), but I’m only eating meat, eggs and cheese/dairy, and I attribute that to some of the AMAZING results I’ve gotten (will sum that up at the end).  I still opt for high quality sources (grassfed beef/dairy when possible, pasture raise eggs, etc), and I’m still using supplements to fill in gaps (Superfood, Flameout, several others), but the Feast has been a carnivore Feast.  Conan approved!  

* After the first week of Anderson squats, I used a larger ROM and started using bands.  That was the right call.  My hip and knee were STILL messed up from Super Squats, and heavy loading was killing them.  The bands allowed me to keep the bar weight low, but the intensity was THROUGH THE ROOF.  Try breaking a dead weight off of chains when it’s banded in place.  It takes EFFORT!  And you can NOT quit once you start. 

* Rather than do 5x10-15 leg curls, I did GHRs.  But along with that, I did them with my push ups and squats, turning it into a circuit workout.  I worked up to a final workout of 15 rounds of 15 GHRs, 20 squats, 15 push ups, then got in the remaining 75 push ups to get my 300, then went for a max set of GHRs.  It was a LOT of GHRs. 

* For benching, week 1 was dead bench, week 2 was dead bench against bands, week 3 was touch and go axle bench, week 4 was pause axle bench with chains.  I ultimately just needed gimmicks to get me through it, but I was getting stronger.

* For pressing, I set out with a goal to get all 8 sets done in 8 minutes, using an EMOM style, so I never increased the weight on it.  Different ways to progress.

* For the squats and shrugs day, I rotated between SSB front squats and SSB squats, primarily because, with a deathset at the end, it was good to use the SSB.  SSB front squats are honestly a hidden gem of a movement that I rediscovered, and I’ll need to include it more in the future.  For the shrugs, I did my best to set it up like a hip and thigh lift, but on one set in particularly I REALLY crunched my left quad and had to eventually settle on trap bar shrugs for the final week.  And I think that’s going to be a more permanent solution.  It just works better.

* On that same day, instead of the leg curl work, I would do GHRs while holding a kettlebell in a goblet squat position.  Honestly: this is an AMAZING hamstring workout.  I made my final one particularly tough by doing sets of 3 every 20 seconds, getting in 9 sets total, then the 2 AMRAPS, then dying.

* For pulls, I did a whole bunch of crazy crap, but it always included the trap bar.  High handle one week, ox lift one week (torqued my knee and wanted to keep loading light on the knee), high handle again but with short rests, low handle.  I stuck with trap bar because my “Dealer’s Choice” was deadlift bar ROM pull progression (I started the cycle on Famine and continued it through Feast, which was like a billion IQ move on my part) and I didn’t need to pull heavy with a strap bar twice in a week.  This also made the rows awesome, as I went with trap bar rows, which are what I’ll bring into Famine.  They’re an awesome movement.

*CARNIVORE FEASTS AND RAMPAGE MEALS*

* This is, of course, the fun stuff.   I’m just gonna post some food porn to give an example of what “carnivore feasting” looking like.

* [Eating a 5lb cheeseburger in 30 minutes]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC1mlgTuxZY)

* I apologize if this seems gratitious, but I just cannot emphasize enough how freeing and ridiculous it is to be able to just eat and eat and eat and see nothing but results.  The protocol is self-perpetuating: as you see yourself transform, you just keep leaning into it.


**BACKGROUND**

*Ancient History Stuff*

* I am 37 years old, 5’9, 182.3lbs as of my writing this, have been lifting weights since I was 14, competed in powerlifting and strongman since 2010, have a background in martial arts/wrestling, have pulled 601, squatted 502 and benched 342 in a meet, lifted more in the gym, and done lots of nutty things in my time.

*More Relevant Background* 

* Prior to starting up Jamie’s diet and program, I had just finished up Super Squats, also a great program for different reasons.  This was an epic run of it, culminating in me squatting 405 for 20 reps and getting fairly jacked…and also just absolutely destroying my body in the process.  If you're curious about my experience contracting RSV and tearing my tricep in the first run and all the elbow/knee/hip pain I had in the second run, here are my two write ups

https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/znfw1m/program_review_super_squats_the_what_would_bruce/

https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/11go5su/program_review_super_squats_3_the_revenge/

* Clearly, a change was needed.

* I fell back to my old standby of reading “5/3/1 Forever” and ran the 5/3/1 Krypteia base phase, using front squats and SSB squats liberally as a means to heal my elbow, but there was more that needed doing.

**CHANGE 1: THE APEX PREDATOR DIET**

* Folks, this write up is HUGE, so I'm gonna cliff notes this part, but I intend to post the fully fleshed out review in my blog over the next few weeks, so if you DO want the nitty gritty, feel free to head over there.  A lot of this can be found in the ""complete overhaul"" write ups.

* I’d read about the Apex Predator Diet before, in Jamie’s “Issuance of Insanity”. Previously, I had written them both off due to the extensive use of protein shakes, but when I considered how much I was spending on solid foods at this point to support myself, I realized a shake based diet would honestly be pretty economical.    I abided by Jamie’s recommendation for lean trainees to have 2 lunch time solid meals a week, since I got to meet my wife on those days for lunch, and my weekends were more solid food based, since that was time I got to spend with my family and I wasn’t going to be drinking shakes while we were out having meals together.  I still needed that social healing.  But, effectively, any time I could have a shake instead of a meal, I went with a shake.

**OUTCOME OF CHANGE #1** 

* I’ve written about this in my blog already as part of my “complete overhaul” series, but to summarize: this change in and of itself was life-changing.  I got back SO much of my life and my time with my family by switching the majority of my meals to shakes.  The two biggest offenders were my breakfasts and my pre-bed meals, of which I’ve logged about before, but they were massive and time consuming.  Ultimately, I needed “permission” to stop eating like that, and having the recommendation of someone like Jamie went a long way.  And after jumping straight in, I found out that I could still train just as hard and be just as strong even without the insane morning and nightly rituals.  

* As this change only lasted the course of the Krypteia base phase and deload, it was only 4 weeks of living this way.  After Super Squats, I still had some fluff to lose, and 4 weeks of dieting really isn’t much in the grand scheme of things, so I was seeing SOME positive physique changes but nothing significant…and then I started following one of Jamie’s programs and things REALLY got interesting.

**CHANGE 2: “FEAST, FAMINE AND FEROCITY”**

* It was practically kismet when Jamie released the Feast, Famine and Ferocity e-book, itself a re-packaging and update of an article series he’s previously released on his website.  I’ll do a review of the book package itself sometime in the future, but a quick summary is it’s a 50 page e-book where half of it is dedicated to the aforementioned program series of “Famine” and “Feast” while the other half is a republishing of his Bruce Randall article.  The later article IS a fantastic read, and I’d read it many times beforehand, but it’s worth appreciating that it’s really more a 30 page e-book in this regard.  That said, much like I wrote about in my review of Ben Pollack’s “Think Big”, a short e-book where every page is gold is SO much more valuable than 300 pages of fluff, and Jamie’s book definitely achieves that standard.

* I genuinely had no intention of changing programs when I bought the book: I just am such a fan of Jamie that when he sells stuff I buy it so I can give him support.  However, upon reading it, I new my fate was sealed, similarly to the first time I read “Super Squats” and was all keyed up to begin my 6 weeks on that program once the book was done.  The primary draw was the fact that the “Famine” diet was VERY similar to the Apex Predator modification I was currently following.  The primary difference is that Famine has NO solid meals whatsoever: all shakes.  I wasn’t about to do THAT, but I did permit myself a few “all shakes” days in the 2 weeks that I followed the program, primarily because my schedule would permit for that…which meant, specifically, my wife would be out of town and I wouldn’t be missing any meals with her.  If she’s around, I’m not going to skip a meal with her to have a shake.  Sorry: priorities.

* I’ll then go on to say that, when I finished the entire book, I thought “Yeah, Famine fits, but this diet has been going so well that I’m not gonna do ‘Feast’.  I’ll do Famine and then something else”.

* Yeah: that fell quickly to the wayside.  Jamie’s programming was so solid that I couldn’t wait to see it all the way through.  So with that, allow me to discuss both programs in a broad scale before going on to discuss each in detail.


----

**CONCLUSION**


* Folks, I could legit talk about this protocol any Jamie’s intervention into my life for a LONG time.  It’s honestly hard to cut myself off here (my current write up is 10 pages in length, but I’m trying to chop it down to make it readable for you).  Please ask questions, but, in general: this has become my favorite protocol in 23 years of training.  Everyone needs to run it.  Everyone needs to try Apex Predator.  Everyone needs to buy stuff from Jamie.  Call me a shill: I don’t care.  This has been life changing.",Fitness,"Program Review: Jamie Lewis' Updated ""Feast Famine and Ferocity"": I am the leanest and strongest i've ever been-**INTRO**

I'm going to write this backwards, starting with the results, going into the program reviews, then the background.  I figure that's really what's important.

---

**STARTING WITH RESULTS**

* It’s so rare I do photos, [so appreciate this](https://i.imgur.com/uwkBgoj.png).  This isn’t 6 weeks purely on FFF, but the end of Super Squats and the final week of “Feast”, so about 9 weeks of change.  



* As far as lift results go, I genuinely hate detailing this stuff, since my training is so wild and difficult to track.  I’m gonna just shutgun some stuff here, but ultimately: I’m the strongest I’ve been in a LONG time while also the leanest.

*  From week 1 to week 4 of Feast, I went from only being able to do 3 rounds of EMOM 200lb log clean and press for doubles to getting through a full 8 rounds of it.

*  From 4 triples of SSB squats w/405 in the first week of Famine to 6 triples of 415 in the third week of Feast

*  4x2x321 axle bench in the first week of Famine, 10x2x301 in week 3 of Feast (with 1 minute rests vs 2+)

* But honestly, stuff like [this]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbtDWEWJ8wA) is really what I find most impressive as far as results.  That’s an 11+4+3x405+chain mat pull, but the context is: I had been walking around the zoo for 6 hours that day, having only had a Metabolic Drive shake for lunch and then coming home from a solid [carnivore feast](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/tnation/original/4X/e/1/d/e1d5ffdf73834fc67487531f81d2d921476cc598.jpeg), and I had 5 minutes before we were going to turn right around and walk the dog (get in my 2 miles).  I threw on some shorts I had on the laundry, warmed up with ONE rep of 155+chains, and then pulled that.  All the daily activity, new stuff I’ve been exposed to, good eating, etc etc has me fully healed and ready to move and act when needed.  I’ve genuinely just never felt more capable and dangerous.

**PROGRAM REVIEW**

*THE PROGRAMS IN GENERAL*

* I’m drawn to Jamie’s programming primarily because he doesn’t rely much on percentages and he encourages experimentation.  His programming is far more ideas and structures than an actual set routine, and the focus is on effort.  What was even more awesome about both Feast and Famine was that Jamie offers a 3-4 day variant and a 5-6 day variant of both programs, so there’s a LOT of flexibility there.  Those 3-4 day variants are LOADED to make it all work out, so, amazingly, I found myself drawn to the 5-6 day variants instead.  Since I get up early to train, I’m able to train 5 days a week without issue and didn’t need to cut down to 3-4 days, despite the fact I’ve written about the value of lifting weights 3-4 days a week to put on size.  It helps that, at this point in my training, putting on size wasn’t the concern: I had Super Squats for that.  For now, the goal was simply to experience the training and see what happened.

**AWESOME ELEMENTS OF FAMINE AND FEAST PROGRAMS**


* Both programs feature a day Jamie refers to as “Dealer’s Choice”, which is as it sounds: do what you want.  For Famine, it’s up to 90 minutes.  For Feast, there’s no set time and Jamie even permits you to make it a day off if needed (which, despite all the increased cals, you may still need: I’ll detail that more later).  Either way is brilliant, and I think EVERY program needs this.  Trainees are stupid.  I’m including myself in there.  Trainees will ALWAYS sneak stupid crap into a program.  Pet lifts (curls, of course), stupid human tricks and gimmicks, “weak areas”, etc.   Trainees will inevitably wreck a program because they’ll change it up too much to fit in all this extra stuff that they end up reducing the effectiveness or flat our violating the intent, turning accumulation into intensification or GPP.  By having ONE day of the program where you just do what you want, you can get it all out of your system and then get back on program.  It’s the “cheat meal” of training.  During Famine, I’d throw in ALL that extra stuff I was doing before: Poundstone curls, lateral raise deathsets, belt squats, Kroc Rows, mat pull ROM progression, etc.  During Feast, my schedule was nuttier, so I often would just continue the ROM progression cycle and, if I had time, throw in some conditioning work and call it good.  But in both cases: my program compliance was MUCH stronger compared to programs I’d run in the past.

* Daily physical requirements/daily work.  Prior to starting up the program, I had my own daily work, which was: 50 chins, 50 dips, 50 pull aparts, 40 reverse hypers, 30 GHRs, 20 standing ab wheels, and often some neck work.  I’d get this done no matter what.  Jamie prescribes a daily 2 mile walk, outside, no matter what, along with 300 squats and 300 push ups.  I balked when I first saw that…and, in turn, loved that I had a new challenge in front of me.  And yeah: the first 2 days, I was SORE AS HELL, but upon adapting, I saw some AMAZING results.  The push ups and squats have honestly been transformative, as I’m seeing veins all over my quads and shoulders, but honestly, that daily 2 mile walk outside has probably been one of the most positive things I’ve ever done for myself.  It’s a chance to clear my head, get in some vitamin D, and bring back some health into my life.  Having it be a daily requirement and forcing myself to come up with ways to fit the walk into my day has been awesome, and my dog is appreciating all the time outside as well, and it’s gotten me to break out my weight vest again to add in even more resistance opportunities.  And that 2 mile walk has become a mere minimum, as I find myself becoming “activity seeking”, and will often get in 2 miles unweighted walking and then an extra 1-2 miles with a weight vest on as well. 

* On the daily work, Jamie is adamant that “this is not part of your workout-it is part of being a human being”.  I appreciate the sentiment there.  Being able to move your body through space is huge.  That said, I was big on making the push ups and squats INTO a workout when possible.  Toward the end, my go to was to use Tabata intervals of 20 seconds on/10 seconds off and do squats during the 20 second and push ups during the 10.  I’d settle on 20 squats per round and 15 push ups, getting me 300 squats in 15 rounds, and then I’d do the remaining push ups as fast as possible.  Keeping to those Tabata intervals makes this a pretty solid conditioning hit and only takes about 9 minutes to knock out.  Typically, I’d do this after the workout on weekdays, and on weekends I took to accomplishing it literally as soon as my feet would hit the floor in the morning.  I HATE working out, still do, and getting this done ASAP was pretty big for me.  Sometimes, though, I’d get cute and start incorporating push ups and squats into a larger conditioning paradigm, like in a circuit with swings, or GHRs, or chins, etc.  But, either way, I always met these goals.

**DEVIATIONS I MADE TO BOTH PROGRAMS**

* Jamie encourages experimentation, so game on.

* Jamie slots that “Dealer’s choice” toward the middle of the week with both programs, but for my work schedule it worked better to put it on Fridays/Weekends.  In the case of Famine, his middle of the week workout is either a day off or a 30 minute bodyweight conditioning circuit, which fit MUCH better with my weekend schedule, so putting that on Sat/Sun and Dealer’s choice on Friday allowed me to get in a 60+ minute dealer’s choice workout, which got in a lot of work.  In the case of Feast, there are 5 loaded days of training that worked much better for M-F for me, and then dealer’s choice on weekends allowed me to get anywhere from a 4-60 minute workout, depending on what my choice was as the dealer.  

* I made sure to run a full week of both programs exactly as written out, to include rest times, exercise order, etc.  In doing so, many of my workouts ran into the 80+ minute mark, which became a bit cumbersome with my schedule, but I wanted to understand how the training “felt” before I mucked with it.  Once I had that baseline established, I broke out the giant sets, short rest times, etc: all those tricks I’ve used in the past to get in more volume in less time.  I still made sure to bring the intensity, but wherever I could find logical pairings and groupings, I’d throw them in.  The 5xAMRAP hanging leg raises that happen EVERY training day are a quick kill, and much of the arm work could work in with other stuff.  Sometimes, though, it’d become something incredibly brutal, like bouncing between heavy shrugs and squats during Feast (more on that later).

* You’ll note I did NOT write about additional conditioning work, extra workouts, etc etc.  Jamie really “fixed” my compulsion here.  I’d be done with the training…and I’d trained “enough”.  This was really pretty huge for me.

*”FAMINE” SPECIFIC OBSERVATIONS/DEVIATIONS*

* With Jamie’s permission, I took full workout footage of all my training sessions of Famine AND Feast, so I’ll post those if you want to see the whole thing in action.

* [Famine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VnicWt6NqU&list=PLfcuGAffLlSdfWeHmA6BsUctSrdGdaObB&pp=iAQB)

* [Feast: Playlist isn't fully updated, but the videos are all on my channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k8jkk6VLec&list=PLfcuGAffLlSf-y7VAbGZ3TVKoE1T5OycC&pp=iAQB)

* I made a few deviations from the programming, more out of equipment limitations.  I don’t have a leg extension or leg curl machine.  For extensions, I could use my reverse hyper, sit on top of it, hook my feet through the straps and do extensions.  That worked well.  Turning around to do curls that way?  Not as great.   I stuck with it through Famine, since it’s only 2 weeks, before eventually just going with GHRs during Feast, and when I return to Famine, that’s where I’ll go.

* My cable set up is pretty janky, so for cable rows I went with landmine t-bar rows instead.  I also don’t have a machine shoulder press, but I rigged up a VERY awesome Viking press set-up with bands that was clutch (you’ll see it on the video).

* Strongman implements regularly featured, because they’re awesome.  I also was making extensive use of the SSB, because I was still pretty broken from Super Squats.

* I didn’t follow the diet 100%, but I met the spirit of it.  LOTS of caffeine, shakes made up the majority of my nutrition, calories were low.  I trained fasted as well.  

*”FEAST” SPECIFIC OBSERVATIONS/DEVIATIONS*

* I underwent a MAJOR nutritional pivot during Feast, and it’s been one of the most positive things I’ve done for myself in a long time.  I absolutely didn’t meet Jamie’s prescription as far as calories goes, primarily because I’m not going to count calories.  In addition, the shakes were still regular features because they went a long way toward streamlining my life.  HOWEVER, for my solid meals: I went carnivore.  I’d been wanting to try out a carnivore diet for a few years now, after listening first to Shawn Baker and then Paul Saladino and a few other carnivore influencers talk to the approach (and constantly hearing Mark Bell beat the drum for it).  This also matches up a bit more directly with how Jamie laid out the “Apex Predator Diet”, as the solid meals were all meat.  I honestly just wasn’t in a good place psychologically to undertake it, but this protocol was VERY freeing in that regard, so I went full steam ahead…and it’s been amazing.  I’ll probably just have to make it another blog post (a continuation of the overhaul series), but I’m only eating meat, eggs and cheese/dairy, and I attribute that to some of the AMAZING results I’ve gotten (will sum that up at the end).  I still opt for high quality sources (grassfed beef/dairy when possible, pasture raise eggs, etc), and I’m still using supplements to fill in gaps (Superfood, Flameout, several others), but the Feast has been a carnivore Feast.  Conan approved!  

* After the first week of Anderson squats, I used a larger ROM and started using bands.  That was the right call.  My hip and knee were STILL messed up from Super Squats, and heavy loading was killing them.  The bands allowed me to keep the bar weight low, but the intensity was THROUGH THE ROOF.  Try breaking a dead weight off of chains when it’s banded in place.  It takes EFFORT!  And you can NOT quit once you start. 

* Rather than do 5x10-15 leg curls, I did GHRs.  But along with that, I did them with my push ups and squats, turning it into a circuit workout.  I worked up to a final workout of 15 rounds of 15 GHRs, 20 squats, 15 push ups, then got in the remaining 75 push ups to get my 300, then went for a max set of GHRs.  It was a LOT of GHRs. 

* For benching, week 1 was dead bench, week 2 was dead bench against bands, week 3 was touch and go axle bench, week 4 was pause axle bench with chains.  I ultimately just needed gimmicks to get me through it, but I was getting stronger.

* For pressing, I set out with a goal to get all 8 sets done in 8 minutes, using an EMOM style, so I never increased the weight on it.  Different ways to progress.

* For the squats and shrugs day, I rotated between SSB front squats and SSB squats, primarily because, with a deathset at the end, it was good to use the SSB.  SSB front squats are honestly a hidden gem of a movement that I rediscovered, and I’ll need to include it more in the future.  For the shrugs, I did my best to set it up like a hip and thigh lift, but on one set in particularly I REALLY crunched my left quad and had to eventually settle on trap bar shrugs for the final week.  And I think that’s going to be a more permanent solution.  It just works better.

* On that same day, instead of the leg curl work, I would do GHRs while holding a kettlebell in a goblet squat position.  Honestly: this is an AMAZING hamstring workout.  I made my final one particularly tough by doing sets of 3 every 20 seconds, getting in 9 sets total, then the 2 AMRAPS, then dying.

* For pulls, I did a whole bunch of crazy crap, but it always included the trap bar.  High handle one week, ox lift one week (torqued my knee and wanted to keep loading light on the knee), high handle again but with short rests, low handle.  I stuck with trap bar because my “Dealer’s Choice” was deadlift bar ROM pull progression (I started the cycle on Famine and continued it through Feast, which was like a billion IQ move on my part) and I didn’t need to pull heavy with a strap bar twice in a week.  This also made the rows awesome, as I went with trap bar rows, which are what I’ll bring into Famine.  They’re an awesome movement.

* [Eating a 5lb cheeseburger in 30 minutes]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC1mlgTuxZY)

* I apologize if this seems gratitious, but I just cannot emphasize enough how freeing and ridiculous it is to be able to just eat and eat and eat and see nothing but results.  The protocol is self-perpetuating: as you see yourself transform, you just keep leaning into it.


**BACKGROUND**

*Ancient History Stuff*

* I am 37 years old, 5’9, 182.3lbs as of my writing this, have been lifting weights since I was 14, competed in powerlifting and strongman since 2010, have a background in martial arts/wrestling, have pulled 601, squatted 502 and benched 342 in a meet, lifted more in the gym, and done lots of nutty things in my time.

*More Relevant Background* 

* Prior to starting up Jamie’s diet and program, I had just finished up Super Squats, also a great program for different reasons.  This was an epic run of it, culminating in me squatting 405 for 20 reps and getting fairly jacked…and also just absolutely destroying my body in the process.  If you're curious about my experience contracting RSV and tearing my tricep in the first run and all the elbow/knee/hip pain I had in the second run, here are my two write ups

https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/znfw1m/program_review_super_squats_the_what_would_bruce/

https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/11go5su/program_review_super_squats_3_the_revenge/

* Clearly, a change was needed.

* I fell back to my old standby of reading “5/3/1 Forever” and ran the 5/3/1 Krypteia base phase, using front squats and SSB squats liberally as a means to heal my elbow, but there was more that needed doing.

**CHANGE 1: THE APEX PREDATOR DIET**

* Folks, this write up is HUGE, so I'm gonna cliff notes this part, but I intend to post the fully fleshed out review in my blog over the next few weeks, so if you DO want the nitty gritty, feel free to head over there.  A lot of this can be found in the ""complete overhaul"" write ups.

* I’d read about the Apex Predator Diet before, in Jamie’s “Issuance of Insanity”. Previously, I had written them both off due to the extensive use of protein shakes, but when I considered how much I was spending on solid foods at this point to support myself, I realized a shake based diet would honestly be pretty economical.    I abided by Jamie’s recommendation for lean trainees to have 2 lunch time solid meals a week, since I got to meet my wife on those days for lunch, and my weekends were more solid food based, since that was time I got to spend with my family and I wasn’t going to be drinking shakes while we were out having meals together.  I still needed that social healing.  But, effectively, any time I could have a shake instead of a meal, I went with a shake.

**OUTCOME OF CHANGE #1** 

* I’ve written about this in my blog already as part of my “complete overhaul” series, but to summarize: this change in and of itself was life-changing.  I got back SO much of my life and my time with my family by switching the majority of my meals to shakes.  The two biggest offenders were my breakfasts and my pre-bed meals, of which I’ve logged about before, but they were massive and time consuming.  Ultimately, I needed “permission” to stop eating like that, and having the recommendation of someone like Jamie went a long way.  And after jumping straight in, I found out that I could still train just as hard and be just as strong even without the insane morning and nightly rituals.  

* As this change only lasted the course of the Krypteia base phase and deload, it was only 4 weeks of living this way.  After Super Squats, I still had some fluff to lose, and 4 weeks of dieting really isn’t much in the grand scheme of things, so I was seeing SOME positive physique changes but nothing significant…and then I started following one of Jamie’s programs and things REALLY got interesting.

**CHANGE 2: “FEAST, FAMINE AND FEROCITY”**

* It was practically kismet when Jamie released the Feast, Famine and Ferocity e-book, itself a re-packaging and update of an article series he’s previously released on his website.  I’ll do a review of the book package itself sometime in the future, but a quick summary is it’s a 50 page e-book where half of it is dedicated to the aforementioned program series of “Famine” and “Feast” while the other half is a republishing of his Bruce Randall article.  The later article IS a fantastic read, and I’d read it many times beforehand, but it’s worth appreciating that it’s really more a 30 page e-book in this regard.  That said, much like I wrote about in my review of Ben Pollack’s “Think Big”, a short e-book where every page is gold is SO much more valuable than 300 pages of fluff, and Jamie’s book definitely achieves that standard.

* I genuinely had no intention of changing programs when I bought the book: I just am such a fan of Jamie that when he sells stuff I buy it so I can give him support.  However, upon reading it, I new my fate was sealed, similarly to the first time I read “Super Squats” and was all keyed up to begin my 6 weeks on that program once the book was done.  The primary draw was the fact that the “Famine” diet was VERY similar to the Apex Predator modification I was currently following.  The primary difference is that Famine has NO solid meals whatsoever: all shakes.  I wasn’t about to do THAT, but I did permit myself a few “all shakes” days in the 2 weeks that I followed the program, primarily because my schedule would permit for that…which meant, specifically, my wife would be out of town and I wouldn’t be missing any meals with her.  If she’s around, I’m not going to skip a meal with her to have a shake.  Sorry: priorities.

* I’ll then go on to say that, when I finished the entire book, I thought “Yeah, Famine fits, but this diet has been going so well that I’m not gonna do ‘Feast’.  I’ll do Famine and then something else”.

* Yeah: that fell quickly to the wayside.  Jamie’s programming was so solid that I couldn’t wait to see it all the way through.  So with that, allow me to discuss both programs in a broad scale before going on to discuss each in detail.


----

**CONCLUSION**


* Folks, I could legit talk about this protocol any Jamie’s intervention into my life for a LONG time.  It’s honestly hard to cut myself off here (my current write up is 10 pages in length, but I’m trying to chop it down to make it readable for you).  Please ask questions, but, in general: this has become my favorite protocol in 23 years of training.  Everyone needs to run it.  Everyone needs to try Apex Predator.  Everyone needs to buy stuff from Jamie.  Call me a shill: I don’t care.  This has been life changing."

But something like wrist curls or shoulder shrugs they don’t feel as intense. I’m wondering because of this, I could have shorter rest periods around 1 min to 1 1/2 min?"

Mainly the volume, currently I train 90-120 minutes 6 days a week and can cover everything plus some.

On one hand, there are powerbuilding plans (like PHAT or brogains)  but most powerbuilding plans are 4 or 5 days and only have 2 or 3 hyportrophy days. Would that be enough to maintain and even progress physique wise or should I expect to lose some ""gains"". And even the 6 day plans I worry that fatigue will be an issue and strength progress will be slow.

On the other hand, there is body building and powerlifting blocks were I cycle between them over blocks of time. This seems great but again I feel like I would lose muscle mass during strength blocks and vise versa. Madcow 5x5 looks very close to what I want but doing so many compound lifts on the same day again fatigue will become and issue and accessory work will take a very long time. 

Finally, I want a program (ideally 5 days/week) that can hit both strength and hyportrophy equally or block cycles that alternate between strength, hyportrophy and hybrids of the two. And lastly something that won't take more than 90-120 minutes (ideally being on the shorter end) .

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.

The latest article from Stronger by Science showcasing a new [meta-analysis on lifters self-selecting loads for their training](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35790622/).

The main conclusion of the review found that both trained and untrained lifters tend to select a load around 53% of their 1RM for sets in the 5-15 rep range.  

The SBS article goes on to discuss the secondary analyses also performed that tease out what may (or may not) have influenced the decision making process.  

In the end, the conclusion shows that most lifters tend to be very conservative in their weight selections, which leads to sets with several reps in the tank.  This suggest that for strength and hypertrophy purposes, the way most people train is leaving a lot of gains on the table:

>My main takeaway from this meta-analysis is that most people self-select loads that are probably too light to build much muscle. Selecting 50-55% 1RM loads for sets of (generally) 10 reps is likely to leave most people with at least 10 reps in reserve for most sets of most exercises, which is unlikely to produce much muscle growth.",Fitness,"Most lifters probably train too light • Stronger by Science-#Link to Article:  [Most lifters probably train too light](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/research-spotlight-train-light/)

2023-05-01 11:01:09,Question about muscle pump,"Hello! So for the last couple months I have been hitting the gym again pretty hard and eating clean. Roughly 2000 cal per day, 200g protein, 200g carbs, 45g fats. Most days I feel good and have a great workout.. some days I feel weak and have a shitty workout.. and generally realize I either didn't rest a muscle group long enough or failed to eat enough carbs. But lately I have had a different issue which is hindering my workouts. Not every work out- maybe every 3rd workout or once a week- I have been getting pumps that are ending my workout sessions early. The pump hits early in my workout and is intense.  Generally I am experiencing it the most in my arms, shoulders, and lats. I get so tight that it is severely limiting my range of motion and increasing the work I have to do to overcome it. Main question is 'what is causing it'? I drink at minimum 2.5L of water per day, but willing to drink more if that could be the problem.  Furthermore, should I just drop weight and work through it or is this early onset pump a warning sign that I shouldn't ignore?",Fitness,"Question about muscle pump-Hello!

The first thing I did was get her into see a pediatrician to ensure her labwork was all in normal ranges and it was. 

She is down 22lbs and is happier more energetic and the whole time was unaware I was trying to curb her weight or that it was a problem. It came down to portion sizes, removing 90% of the snacky food from the house. Limiting (non homework) Screen time to 1 hour a day (2 if she is very physical through the day) or if she wanted to watch a movie or a hockey game we made exceptions etc and biking/walking places instead of me driving her to school hobbies, friends, parks etc. She was put into Kids boxing, and Kids BJJ (as per her request) These are twice a week.

So thank you all for your help.

My daughter is now 10 and very interested and competitive for track. I am not a runner. I don't know how to train for sprints. I don't know how to train for long distance besides get out there and run till you cant anymore. I do know she wants to train everyday mostly, and I want to get her started in good habits. Including rest days and knowing limitations.

For 10 year old girls, How do you train for sprints? what should I be focusing on to support her. She made it clear she wants to win, she made it clear she wants to work to win. (whether this happens or doesn't, doesn't matter well cross that bridge the day of) Do you guys know any resources or advice to help us on our way? I love this little girl so much with everything I have so I want to set her up for the most success and support she can get from a lower middle class dad.

Limiting (non homework) Screen time to 1 hour a day (2 if she is very physical through the day) or if she wanted to watch a movie or a hockey game we made exceptions etc and biking/walking places instead of me driving her to school hobbies, friends, parks etc. She was put into Kids boxing, and Kids BJJ (as per her request) These are twice a week.

So thank you all for your help.

My daughter is now 10 and very interested and competitive for track. I am not a runner. I don't know how to train for sprints. I don't know how to train for long distance besides get out there and run till you cant anymore. I do know she wants to train everyday mostly, and I want to get her started in good habits. Including rest days and knowing limitations.

For 10 year old girls, How do you train for sprints? what should I be focusing on to support her. She made it clear she wants to win, she made it clear she wants to work to win. (whether this happens or doesn't, doesn't matter well cross that bridge the day of) Do you guys know any resources or advice to help us on our way? I love this little girl so much with everything I have so I want to set her up for the most success and support she can get from a lower middle class dad.

Thanks again!"

Daily lift ""journal"" and highlights can be found on my Tok of the Tik, which is located in my profile.

&#x200B;

**Personal Stats:**

Age: 50

Body Weight: Start: 249lbs    End: 251.1lbs

&#x200B;

**Goals:** My goal at 50 years old was to hit 315....and I got it...once. I really wanted to get myself past the (probably self-imposed mental) plateau of a single rep at 315, and into the realm where I wasn't as.....apprehensive?.....about being under the bar with heavy weight, and be able to sustain it with high frequency.

\---

The first thing I'll say about this program is that it will teach you humility very, very quickly if you don't RTFM. Specifically, the author states *""When you start out a program like this, you need to be conservative. I had to hit 4 reps at 85% of my 1rm every day, and follow that up with a ton of volume.""* If you go into this program and overestimate from the start, you're going to have a very rough time...like...the 2nd week. To that end, I dropped my 1RM numbers by 20lbs right at the onset, as I could see (using my spreadsheet) some of the numbers later on in the program. Excel for the win, there...

**Starting Lifts** (all weight in lbs)

    Focus Lift / Starting 1RM
    Bench Press: 300 
    Deadlift: 185 (back injury)
    Squat: 115 (back injury)
    
    Assistance Lifts / Starting 1RM
    Close Grip Bench: 245
    Incline Bench: 215
    Decline Bench: 225
    Seated OHP: 165
    Sling Shot Bench: 315
    
    Supplemental Lifts	
    Lat Pulldowns: 120
    Cable Seated 1-Arm Row (superset 10x neutral, overhand, supine): 35
    EZ Bar Curl: 65
    Tricep Pushdowns: 65

I must say, my Kabuki Kadillac bar was a complete shoulder saver - I highly doubt at my age that my shoulders could have taken the abuse that this program dishes out. So, recommendation is that if you're old(er), neutral grip can be your best friend (but still have aleve on hand).

I didn't forget about standard grip! My slingshot (which I bought specifically for this program and was getting used to during the 7 weeks) was done with standard grip, and I know that I'll have to compete with regular grip, but I felt that give the frequency of training, I would rather avoid potential injury. 50 days - no hurty. Success.

Most days I kept my start time right about 2:30pm, and was in and out of my garage in 60-90 minutes. Some days were obviously much much shorter than that, and a couple (looking at you, 14-set day in week 2) that went longer, but that was my average. I think that younger folks who require less rest time could also cut that time down dramatically. I don't think I'd recommend this program on a cut - it seems to be built for those who are in a bulk, or possibly (like me) a recomp (ok, fair enough, beer belly isn't really a recomp, but I did lose a couple of pants sizes). I didn't have any recovery issues - got plenty of sleep, took my creatine and drank plenty of water, and got (mostly) enough protein. One thing I should have done better is cut back on the alcohol...there were a couple of days that weren't pretty because of that.

Speaking of not pretty - there will be days when you just fail....bad. Like, can't lift the bar after a set bad. As the author says, *""It is perfectly fine to just stack a brick in the wall and leave.""* There are quite a couple ""0"" reps in my spreadsheet, but luckily I bounced back from nearly all of them. There are also a couple of days that were, in my opinion, just unrealistic to hit. An example was Week 1 (Day 6), having to hit 102% of your estimated 1RM, and the same for Week 7 (Day 48). I chose to put a little less weight on the bar (ok, a lot less weight) rather than potentially risk injury. This may just be //my// fault based upon how I interpreted the author's initial post and converted it to my spreadsheet, but I'm pretty sure I got the calculations right, so...maybe that was just the intent, to //really// put the lifter out of his/her comfort zone.

At the end of the 50 days, though, I think the results speak for themselves here. I completely smashed any and all expectations that I had going in. I quite honestly never expected to do 320 for 5 reps in just 7 weeks, or put 345 up for 1. I'm also very glad that my back is feeling better (but squats still suck ass).

**Results:** (all weight in lbs)

    Bench Press: 	 Start 1RM: 315	End (Est) 1RM:	373.86	/ 58.9 lbs or 18.69%
    Deadlift:	 Start 1RM: 185	End (Est) 1RM:	401.37	/ 216.4 lbs or 116.96%
    Squat:		 Start 1RM: 115	End (Est) 1RM:	286.13	/ 171.1 lbs or 148.81%
    Close Grip Bench: Start 1RM: 265 End (Est) 1RM:	327.49	/ 62.5 lbs or 23.58%
    Incline Bench:	 Start 1RM: 235	End (Est) 1RM:	302.56	/ 67.6 lbs or 28.75%
    Decline Bench:   Start 1RM: 245	End (Est) 1RM:	361.10	/ 116.1 lbs or 47.39%
    Seated OHP: 	 Start 1RM: 185	End (Est) 1RM:	239.35  / 54.3 lbs or 29.38%
    Sling Shot Bench: Start 1RM: 315 End (Est) 1RM:	410.95	/ 95.9 lbs or 30.46%

What's next? Not sure. I don't see myself coming back to this for a little bit, but yeah...I can see myself doing this again...just not next week. It was fun, it was challenging, but man....it was tiring, and I'm old.

Aloha!

2023-04-14 02:30:56,Four Years Without A Rest Day,"The goal of this post is to provide a brief description of my training, the things I’ve accomplished, and a few tips to help make it easier for you to also begin training daily. 

Throughout this post I will be linking to other resources of mine that will provide more depth and detail to my training, including specific programs, workouts, lifts, etc. Follow those links to get more out of this post than what is summarized here. 

With what is provided in this post I am confident that you can train yourself effectively for the rest of your life. 

**TLDR**

I have not taken a rest day for over four years. This means I have worked out every day for over 1,460 consecutive days (as of this writing it is closer to 1,500 days). Nearly all my workouts have been with weights, an overwhelming majority being barbells.  

I got bigger, stronger, and fitter in general. 

**Why Do I Workout Daily?** 

The short answer is that it benefits me greatly. 

Here is the long answer (blog): [Physicality, Creativity, and Consciousness.](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2023/04/physicality-creativity-and-consciousness.html)

**Why Should You Workout Daily?**

Because daily exercise is fundamental to living a healthy life. It may also [benefit you mentally](https://www.ihrsa.org/improve-your-club/new-report-exercise-plays-key-role-in-mental-health-well-being/) and spiritually, not just physically (read the above linked blog post to understand my philosophy of all this). 

I have had many, many people contact me about training daily and provide feedback about how their lives have improved. The outpouring of encouragement and mutual commitment to daily training has been inspiring. Therefore, I have reason to believe that you could see similar benefits. 

**Training Structure and Results (Summary Achievements)** 

I use my [General Gainz](https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/aqkdgo/happy_gday_gainerz/) training framework to structure my workouts and progression. 

Currently I am focused on getting an all-time 1RM PR for [squat and bench](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cq8D8Ecgxgj/). I am within 85% of those numbers at this time, despite not training specifically for powerlifting as I did in the past. For context, I do a lot more conditioning work now compared to my best powerlifting days. 

For several periods during these four years I would train the same lift every day. Like the [squat](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5nlw7pgZ04/?img_index=1), which helped me accomplish a 20-rep max PR. As well as the [press](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5i4OGAAyl_/?img_index=1), which helped me get a 1RM PR. 

In about an eight-hour period I hiked four 14,000-foot mountains then went to my gym and completed a powerlifting total of 1,240 pounds. ([video](https://www.instagram.com/p/CiaTQzxAOcr/).)

Other periods of time I did a [body part split](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2022/01/general-gainz-body-building.html). This helped me grow my arms to nearly 18-inches while weighing less than 200 pounds. 

During other periods of time I focused on conditioning, which allowed me to squat a tremendous number of reps ([225x51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxlK7QEI2dw) and [135x5x44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05U-51I92pk)). Both of those were very recent. 

On the anniversary of four years, I aimed to hit a 1,460-pound total doing lifts that I never (or rarely) have ever trained. These were the Zercher squat (315 lbs.), Reverse Grip Bench (265 lbs.), Jefferson Deadlift (565 lbs.), Behind the Neck Press (185 lbs.), and Strict EZ Bar Curl (130 lbs.). For further context, on the day of these lifts I weighed about 190 pounds and was deep into conditioning focused training, not peak strength, nor was I training for these lifts at this time. I was simply strong enough to move this weight despite not training heavy. ([video](https://www.instagram.com/p/CpyXVv1gLaX/).)

**How to Train Daily?** 

**Tip #1: Focus on recovery!** Eat, hydrate, sleep, and destress as much as you can (or need to). Though I was not perfect in every aspect, I was consistently doing well in all of these. At times I do have poor nights of sleep, however, this has been less so since I started training daily. My diet wasn’t perfect, some days I was super busy and barely ate, other days I overate. 

On average I ate well and got about .75 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight and remained well hydrated daily. I didn't let an imperfect day of eating ruin the greater goal: to keep training daily. 

Lastly, find time for you to pray or meditate, or read, or go for a nice casual hike – do something that alleviates stress (something that isn’t considered “training”). 

**Tip #2: Develop work capacity.** This is the foundation of recovery. If you have little work capacity, then you will quickly overreach. By having a high work capacity you can still train a lot, and have challenging workouts, yet it will take a whole lot more to push you into recovery debt. Think of it like this, if you can do more in your usual training, then your “deload” workouts will look like the average gym goer’s limit. Not only that, but even a slight reduction in load or volume will benefit you that much more. This is because your body develops the ability to recover as you develop work capacity, so when you decide to go a bit easier, the recovery time is faster due to the reduced load, volume, and/or density in your training. 

How to develop work capacity: gradually add more work! Do another exercise at the end of your workouts, or add another set, or more reps to your sets. You could do a workout that has higher reps than your usual. You could begin tracking your rest and work towards less rest, thereby increasing your training density. You could do “mini-workouts” where you quickly complete several sets of bodyweight exercises HIIT style. Sled push, drag, carry weight, do sprints, walk more, swim, hike; get your heart rate up, keep it there for longer than you usually do, and do it more often. 

More insight on developing work capacity: [The Process is the Goal.](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2022/10/1300-days-process-is-goal.html)

**Tip #3: Use a flexible schedule.** Had I strict days on which to do specific lifts, loads, and volumes, then I would have failed and given up years ago. Because I remained flexible in my training, both in structure and progression, I was able to train daily and continue inching towards ever more challenging goals. Perhaps my legs were not recovered from a tough squat workout. No problem, I would do a lighter day instead and focus on volume, rep speed, pauses, or some other quality. Likewise, if my arms were still feeling weak after a hard day of benching, then I would do lighter arm exercises, which aided in their recovery. 

Though I haven’t had a pre-planned dedicated deload week in these four years, I have intentionally taken “easier days” on account of lack of sleep, being ill, having migraines (I have chronic rhinitis and sinusitis). An easier day might be just doing arms and getting a great pump. Or instead of going for heavy squats I would do lighter ones and focus on speed (both bar speed, but also shortening my rest and getting the workout done quickly). 

Here's a helpful planner made by /u/benjaminbk 

[Burrito But Big: A 'General Gainz'-based 12-Week Planner](https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/12ggfn7/burrito_but_big_a_general_gainzbased_12week/)

Another insightful read by the same author: [365 Days and Counting](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2021/12/365-days-and-counting.html) (Includes great tips on how to develop work capacity!)

**Tip #4: Realize that you must train tomorrow.** This has been tremendously helpful for me because it helps regulate my workout *today*. When I was taking rest days I would all too often go hard, way too hard, because “tomorrow I get to sit around and recover.” I had a false understanding of recovery back then. Because of that I would grind myself into the ground at the gym and not recover all weekend, then hit Monday again, hard, and over several weeks push myself deeper into recovery debt. 

Now, because I train daily, I am better at regulating my efforts in the gym. I am much more accurate when it comes to estimating my effort and determining when to go for more weight, or for more reps, and when to back off of one or both. Because I’ll be training tomorrow, and ultimately that’s the priority (daily consistency), then I will govern what I do today accordingly. This requires flexibility and having a good understanding of how to progress (which is why I so dearly love my General Gainz training framework). 

**Tip #5: Start small. Start NOW**. Do not wait for the perfect plan. Do not wait to have all information you feel might be necessary to have the OpTiMaL PrOgRaM. Do not wait until you move to that fancy new gym with all the best machines. Do not wait until your schedule is more relaxed. Action produces results, results build momentum, momentum produces further action. 

It is easy to start training daily. Begin small. Really small. It can be as little as a set of push-ups for those who are new to training. Let where you are dictate how you start training daily. If you’re deep into powerlifting or bodybuilding, start including more cardio: go for a quarter mile jog (then on your next former-rest-day, go for a block longer, or try doing the same distance a little faster. You get the idea). If you’re more of a cardio enthusiast than a lifter, then do a circuit of bodyweight exercises instead of your next rest day (or, wild idea, just run every day…)

The easiest way to exercise daily is to simply *do what you like every day*. Don’t let a schedule, a program, equipment, or anything else stop you. Short of an emergency, you have time. If you don’t – then you need to examine your priorities (which this post cannot do for you).   

**What to do when sick?**

On days when I wasn’t feeling well, I still trained, but went easy. And because I have a great work capacity, these training days didn’t make me sicker. In fact, I’ve only been ill twice, and then only for a few days. I recover rapidly from workouts, and I surmise that the same is true for when I get exposed to illnesses. 

The most common illness I got was migraines during this period. On these days I would train arms. No doubt this contributed to the arm growth I achieved. 

**Conclusion**

I hope this post communicated why you should and how you can train daily. Doing so has helped me more than I could have imagined when I started, nearly 1,500 days ago. Though I have been lifting for nearly 15 years, I consider these four to be the most fulfilling and achievement filled. [This is not about discipline, but passion.](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2022/01/1000-days.html) 

Because of my experience, and the experience of those I’ve trained and talked with (who also trained/train without rest days) I am confident that you too will see similar benefits.

# History

### Pre Weights

I was a tall, lanky kid with very little coordination through primary and high school. I did the usual sports that an Australian boy growing up near the coast did through high school – bodyboarding, swimming, cricket, touch footy – but none to a high level or competitively. 

The gym seemed weird, scary, and full of unintellectual “bros”, but I first stepped inside when I realised that swimming wasn’t going to get me jacked by itself. I was pretty inconsistent when I first started, doing a mix of Starting Strength, exercise classes, and a program my first trainer had written me.

### Years 1-2: Greyskull LP, Candito’s LP, Candito’s 6 Week, Stronger By Science 2x Bench

| Weight | 82-89 |
| --- | --- |
| Squat | 60-155kg |
| Bench | 40-15kg |
| Deadlift  | 80-185kg |

**Training**

I followed a pretty standard linear progression for the first year, mainly Greyskull and Candito’s Linear Progression. When progressing from session to session got hard, I moved to a basic linear periodization program with Candito’s 6 Week for squats and deadlifts and Stronger By Science’s 2x Med Int Bench for bench (duh). 

After a couple of years in 2018, I entered [a novice comp and totaled 455kg](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/6tdxmb/meet_report_ptc_winter_improvers_comp_sydney_nsw/) at around 89kg, but I was still pretty clueless about lifting technique and programming. A prime example – I trained on a 25kg squat bar for most of my prep without realising, then was very confused when squats seemed extremely light in competition. I also trained on a deadlift bar and bumpers, then almost missed my opening deadlift on comp plates because all my projected maxes were off. 

I thought I knew a lot about technique from watching and reading a lot, but clearly my lifts were pretty bad. I was pulling sumo because it felt easier on my lower back, but that was just because I hadn’t figured out how to hinge yet. 

**Diet**

I aimed for about 1.5 grams of protein per kilo of bodyweight, and didn’t pay too much attention to carbs and fats as long as I hit my daily calories. I also didn’t worry about vegetables and nutrients. During this time, I dialled my drinking back a little, but I was still drinking very heavily one night a week while partying with my buddies and seeing music. Overall, my compliance with my calorie targets was around 65-70% and my recovery was pretty poor. 

## Years 3-4: GZCL, SSPT, Average to Savage 1.0

| Weight | 89-103-96kg |
| --- | --- |
| Squat | 210kg |
| Bench | 135kg |
| Deadlift  | 235kg |

**Training**

I started to branch out more into some longer linear periodisation via GZCL’s Jacked and Tan 2.0 and The Rippler, then tried out a [more specific powerlifting program SSPT](https://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/7wix39/program_review_sspt_high_performance_training/). I even ran a program [by Brian Alsruhe, Powerbuilder,](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/amkupb/program_review_powerbuilder_by_brian_alsruhe/) during a cut. I then picked up [Average to Savage 1.0](https://www.reddit.com/r/AverageToSavage/comments/98wzzk/average_to_savage_3x_medium_int_aka_bench_more_to/), a simple linear periodisation program, and started cycling that consistently while working in some more bench volume. I competed and [set a 580kg total at 103kg around the 3-4 year mark](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/da9tk1/meet_report_top_lifter_iv_sydney_nsw_australia/). 

I still had no idea what I was doing, technique-wise, and managed to pull something in my lower back from a poorly-executed AMRAP on some sumo deadlifts. Apart from that, I was fairly injury-free apart from niggles. 

**Diet**

I completed my first cut from 95kg to around 90kg, before bulking up and breaking the 100kg barrier for a competition. From memory, my calorie consumption peaked around 3,900 or so. I still wasn’t paying attention to macros other than protein, and my compliance was still around 65-70%. I moved in with my girlfriend, however, and that meant I started to dial back the partying and alcohol consumption. 

## Years 5-Now: A Coach, More Volume, Squatting Every Day, Sandbags, PRs

| Weight | 96-105-93-100-93 |
| --- | --- |
| Squat | 220kg |
| Bench | 155kg |
| Deadlift | 270kg |

**Training**

A few weeks before my meet in 2019, I got talking to a guy at the gym squatting 240kg with ease. Turns out he was a coach, and told me I should be much stronger than I am because my technique sucked. I figured he was right, so I hired him to handle my training and nutrition. 

We spent a lot of time focusing on my technique, building weak points, squatting high bar, pulling conventional, and getting better at benching. I even spent about 8 months squatting using a Bulgarian program, which was good fun until I got sick of squatting to a max every day. I did learn a lot about fatigue, skill practice, and how to grind, and put 55kg on my high bar squat. 

In general, we did a lot more volume overall, about 25% more than before across main lifts and assistance. We spent more time in the 1-5 rep range for my main lifts while we pushed assistance to up to 20 reps. We focused a lot on incline pressing and pec work (chest flies), hamstring and glute work (good mornings and back extensions), and back work of all kinds. In general, the goal was to get me technically better, bigger, more jacked, and more resilient to injury. 

COVID hit during this time, so I bought some sandbags, trained in my basement carpark, and set some all-time deadlift and squat PRs, which you can read about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/h8oilo/enter_the_sandman_8_weeks_of_sandbag_training/). During the second wave, I did the same thing, but was limited by some knee issues that cropped up. 

I also took more of an interest in anatomy and biomechanics by taking A[ustralian Strength Coach’s Strength System Certification](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/mgc4xv/course_review_strength_system_certification_level/), which was a course that covered anatomy, program design, technique, and rest and recovery. While the programming wasn’t ground-breaking for me (my coach has very similar programming philosophies as Sebastian Oreb), I found the anatomy portions very useful to start thinking about movements in more detail. 

When things opened back up, I competed again in 2021, setting a [603kg total at 104kg](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/jwmkui/meet_report_paragon_open_sydney_nsw_aus_603kg/), then most recently, a [622.5kg total at 100kg at the end of last year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/104gbqb/meet_report_strength_tribe_end_of_year_send/) I then cut down to 93kg in time for my wedding so I could look lean AF and good in a suit. 

**Diet**

My diet shifted here – my coach got me on a high-carb, low-fat, moderate-protein approach. This looked like 180-200gm protein, 40-70gm fat (depending on whether I was bulking or cutting), and the rest into carbs. The biggest thing that changed was the volume of food. To get to 105kg, we needed to go as high as 5,000 calories per day, which was a mental amount of food. I think one day, I hit 800gm of carbs. At the depths of the cut, we got to 2,400 cals. 

Over these years, I got much better at adherence to calorie targets (hitting 90-100% consistently). I also got much better at nutrient quality and getting in fruits and veggies while still having flexibility in the kitchen as I like to cook. I developed my own system of shopping and food prep which I’m happy to write about if people are interested. 

As an example, a typical day might look like:

*Breakfast*

- Two cups oats, 200gm greek yoghurt, 1 cup mixed berries, 1 tbsp golden syrup with added water, blended into a smoothie.

*Lunch*

- 200gm kangaroo mince, 200gm capsicum, frozen spinach, 350gm white rice, chicken stock

*****Snack*****

- Two scoops whey, shaken over ice, 2 slices toast with jam

******Dinner******

- 200gm lean protein in an Italian ragu, 125gm pasta, 70gm lettuce with dressing

I’m fairly utilitarian in what I eat during the week, but I’m a big fan of food, so I might cook something fancy or go out to dinner on the weekends. The way I see it, I get most of my basic nutrition out of the way with minimal thought, which frees up calories to eat something different or get creative with cooking in the kitchen. 

## Years 8+

**Training**

My overall goal is a 700kg total in competition. I set it way back when I first started when a 700kg total in the 105kg class would qualify you for Worlds in Australia. The totals have gone up now, but that still remains what I want to hit. For me, that number means I’ve taken myself from novice to fairly respectable strength athlete, which is why I want it so bad. 

Someday I’ll improve my lagging squat, always my Achilles Heel. 

However, for now I’m sick of powerlifting, so I’ve picked up some BJJ to learn a new skill and have fun until the lifting fire starts burning again. Until then. I’m enjoying using my strength and weight for a combat sport, even if I still get smashed by most other people in my class.

# Lessons

In no particular order, here’s what I’ve learned from lifting over the years. 

- **Show up, ask questions, keep going** (from Dan John). Getting where you want is simple – just follow these three steps over and over again. Just like anything else, getting good at lifting takes time, patience, and knowledge, and consistency, curiosity, and persistence will get you there. And the time and money you spend educating yourself will pay off significantly later on.
- **Cultivate your passion for training, whatever that means for you.** Some people can chug away at the same program for years. I'm not one of them. I tend to lose my training mojo if I focus on one goal for too long. I get better consistency from changing up what we're focusing on. When my motivation starts waning, we switch up programming to learn new things and keep it fun, like making push press and front squats a main movement and trying to learn handstands, for example. This keeps the fire burning for when I inevitably feel the urge to get back to powerlifting.
- **Have a support network of people around you.** A good coach is invaluable, but you also want a good physical therapist to keep you healthy, heal things, and get you performing better. Having other people to consult in addition to your coach or to push you more helps an enormous amount. I've got other people I talk to about training like u/NRLlifts to help troubleshoot or tell me I’m being a wuss.
- **Your program matters way less than how well you execute that program.** I used to think the key was finding the optimal program, and that the perfect combination of volume, intensity, and frequency would get me strong. Now, I'm figuring out that the most important thing is how well you execute a program. Is your technique good every set, and are you constantly trying to improve it? Do you know what you're trying to achieve with each exercise and change your exercise tempo and execution to do that? Do you make smart training decisions when things feel light or heavy? Do you slowly evolve your program over time to make it work for you? That’s what will determine a successful training block.
- **Technical development is number one.** This is weirdly controversial, but I do think there are fundamental technical principles (eg staying tight, getting the primary movers lifting the weight, maintaining torso rigidity) for each lift that you should be constantly working on. Unlike “perfect form” which apparently needs you to deload to the bar every so often, excellent technique should allow you to lift the most weight possible, and you should always work to improve yours. Here, an in-person coach can really help. You can watch all the YouTube you want, but proprioception (understanding how your body feels moving in space) is critical to technique development.
- **You need to eat more.** Especially if you're tall. To look jacked and get strong you'll need to put on a lot of weight and muscle, and to do that you'll need to shovel down food. It took me way more food than I thought to get to 105kg.
- **It’s recovery dummy.** See above point. Nailing your recovery will get you stronger. The easiest place to get your numbers up is to improve your nutrition, sleep, stress, and alcohol consumption. Magic will happen when you get those in order as you leave more recovery resources for your body to adapt with.
- **You’ll get injured, and that’s fine.** Injuries are inevitable if you're trying to get stronger, but rarely are they life-altering. Injury recovery is a skill worth learning in itself. When you're hurt, you should be thinking “how can I heal this as quickly as possible, and what else can I work on in the meantime?” If your knee hurts, you can bench. If your elbow hurts, you can front squat. There is always something to improve while you're working on rehab. For more on injury recovery and mindset, read [this brilliant write-up](https://jujimufu.com/blogs/training/jujimufu-on-injuries) from Jujimufu.
- **What you do outside the gym matters** Often, we assume that only what we do in the gym impacts our lifts and the way we move. But when you think about it, we only spend 1-2 hours training, which leaves 22-23 hours for us to move and impact ourselves in other ways. If things start going wrong, the first place to look is outside. A real-life example: I was prepping for a meet and things were going well. All of a sudden, my squat nosedived. I went from squatting 190-200kg high bar to missing 170kg low bar. My coach and I went through every detail, and it turned out 6 weeks ago I'd bought a pair of shoes that was too small. I stopped wearing them, my squat recovered, and I set a 5kg PR in comp. Whatever those shoes did, they made it very hard for me to balance. 
- **Lifting will change you in ways you won’t expect.** I didn't expect lifting to have such a profound impact on me. I was a smart kid who didn't have to try that hard in school, so a hobby like lifting where I couldn't just cruise through was shocking and refreshing. 7 years into lifting, I'm far more disciplined, hard-working, and systematic in how I handle problems, and I’m way more confident in myself and my ability to accomplish goals, professionally and personally. And looking kind of jacked is pretty nice as well.

If you made it this far, I hope you took something useful from it. Always happy to answer any questions if you got em. Happy training!",Fitness,"Progress Post: 7 Years of Showing Up, Asking Questions, and Trying Hard-## Summary

# History

### Pre Weights

I was a tall, lanky kid with very little coordination through primary and high school. I did the usual sports that an Australian boy growing up near the coast did through high school – bodyboarding, swimming, cricket, touch footy – but none to a high level or competitively. 

The gym seemed weird, scary, and full of unintellectual “bros”, but I first stepped inside when I realised that swimming wasn’t going to get me jacked by itself. I was pretty inconsistent when I first started, doing a mix of Starting Strength, exercise classes, and a program my first trainer had written me.

If you made it this far, I hope you took something useful from it. Always happy to answer any questions if you got em. Happy training!"

# Background & Photos


I've never been into fitness, or any sport for that matter, and I've been working a sedentary job ever since I turned 18. My hobbies largely involved indoor activities too, such as video or board games.


In December 2018 (27 y/o), I was at my highest weight of 110.0kg: [Photos here](https://imgur.com/a/JtAdkdc)


By late December 2019 (28 y/o), I had managed to drop down to around 83-85kg: [Photos here](https://imgur.com/a/OhiBblJ)


In January 2020, I realized I've reached a point where I didn't feel I can maintain my diet anymore, I needed some sort of an exercise in my life. I decided to hit the gym with a program designed by myself, for the curious, here's what it looked like: [Fuck-around Program](https://imgur.com/0I3M8dw)


I did that program in and between lockdowns in 2020 but by April 2021 I realized it's not really working, so I moved on to 5/3/1.


Current physique, April '23; please bear in mind the photos are taken after a gym session, so lightning and pump are probably in my favour:

# Training Max Progress, PRs, Program


[Graph of my TMs](https://imgur.com/zJgxCBr)


I've tried to capture the TMs every couple of months, but you'll notice there's a significant gap between March '22 and August '22. The reason for this gap is that I had friends visit me for 10 days mid-April, a tattoo appointment mid-May and I travelled back home for 10 days end of June/start of July. Because of that, I spent significant time out of the gym and each time I went back to it, I'd go back to Week 1.


## Lifts 


*Squat*:
In summer '22, I switched from high bar squat to low bar squat - I never quite felt comfortable in my form and I found low bar squat to feel much better for me personally and I immediately saw an increase in my TM.


*Bench*:
In early autumn '22, I had to reset my bench TM as I failed to achieve even 3 reps during my TM testing week. Over the next iteration, I made dumbbell bench press one of my Push accessory exercises and I believe that helped me progress it further.


*Overhead Press*:
OHP has always been my nemesis lift and I spent basically all of '22 resetting it over and over again. I came to realize I feel a lot of tension in my core area during the lifts, so that, along with Deadlifts, made me finally include core work. In January this year, I somehow finally managed to hit 1 plate (along with extra 2.5kg) during my TM test! Video of that over here:
[1 plate OHP](https://imgur.com/P3oh4ye)


I believe doing Smith machine OHP, as well as back hyperexentions, helped me tons with increasing the weight on this.


*Deadlift*:
No complaints around this one, it has been progressing steadily but it did make me realize how much I rely on my core for the whole movement so it was a big motivator to include core work in my program.


Personal Records as of today, based on Week 3 AMRAP set:


| Lift | Reps x Weight (kg) | 
|:-------|:-----------|
| OHP | 2 x 65 |
| Squat | 5 x 127.5 |
| Bench | 5 x 97.5 |
| Deadlift | 5 x 165 |


## Assistance Work


I've always aimed to get 100 reps in all assistance work categories, usually 2 exercises with 50 reps each (5x10). Instead of core work, I used to do legs and contrary to what the program recommends, I did bilateral leg work as my time spent in gym was close to, and sometimes depending on how busy the gym was, surpassing the 2 hours mark.


For the first year, I didn't stick to specific assistance work for X amount of iterations - I'd have *preferred* exercises to do (such as lat pulldows, the pec flys machine and leg extensions), but I'd often do something else, especially if there's a queue for the machines/racks I need to use, but as time went by, I started sticking to specific exercises for 3 iterations of the program, plus the TM testing week (10 weeks total). My general rule of thumb was to work with weight I can properly do my sets and reps without feeling like I'm putting in no effort. Only once I feel comfortable with the weight, I'd bump it up a bit and repeat.


All my accessory work was focused on the main muscle groups - chest, back, legs - I never did any arms-isolating exercises and instead I let those be trained as a supplement group. My general go-to are:


Push: Dumbbell press, Incline/Decline bench, Pec fly, Smith machine OHP;


Pull: Lat pulldowns, Seated and Barbell rows;


Legs: Press, Extensions, Curls, Bulgarian split-squats;


Core: ABS roll, Hyperextensions, good ole crunches.


I never did deload weeks -  between the ongoing tattoo project across my upper body and traveling back home, I'd take 7 to 14 days break from the gym after my appointments to let the skin heal properly. After each break, I'd revert back to Week 1 of my current iteration, regardless of where I've had to stop, reason being that I often found myself too weak to jump straight back into Week 3, for example, after such a break.


# Diet & Supplements


My diet throughout the past two years has been very simple - get the minimum amount of protein to stimulate muscle growth and have as varied and as healthy diet as possible while still allowing myself less-than-ideal, as well as flat out junk, food, but in moderation. I've done no bulks or cuts and instead focused on what I believe is called ""body recomp"". I figured that once I find something I truly enjoy, I'd eventually reach sort of an equilibrium between what I eat and how many calories I burn which will result in me maintaining my weight. 


I started 5/3/1 at 82.8kg, throughout the 2 years my weight has varied from 82kg to 89kg, currently being 86.6kg. I've done no calories tracking in this period.


My day-to-day diet looks like this:


Morning: 2 coffees with skimmed milk


Lunch: 250g grilled chicken breasts with 410g of baked beans


On workout days, in the afternoon roughly 2 hours before my workout, I'd have a pot of skyr (450g) with a banana and honey


Dinner: Chicken/Pork/Beef/Fish with anything high in carbs, mainly boiled rice or baked potatoes alongside some green salad, olives etc. Dinner calories would usually vary based on what I cook, but these are the general ingredients included. My general rule of thumb was to avoid meals & recipes very high in (saturated) fats or salt, and frying anything.


Pre-bed: Pot of skyr (450g) with a banana and honey


As for supplements, over the years I tried taking creatine, fish oil, magnesium, vitamins and glucosamine but I never built the habit of consistently taking any of them on a daily basis. I stopped buying creatine a long time ago as I'd usually just end up throwing it away and most of the vitamins I take only occasionally.


# Goals & Closing Words


I'm hoping that by the end of the year, I'll be able to hit 2/3/4 plates for bench, squat and deadlift. I'd also like to move on to more systematized program, likely still within the 5/3/1 framework once I get my hands on the 5/3/1 Forever book, and just keep on building on the foundation I've got so far.


Finally, I cannot thank everyone in this sub who's answered my questions across all the threads. Thank you for being so welcoming and so helpful. When I first walked into the gym, I had no idea what to expect, now I spend almost as much time talking to people as I do lifting weights, y'all gym folks are great.",Fitness,"(31M, 185cm, 86.6kg) 2 years of 5/3/1 for beginners-Hey r/fitness!

2023-04-10 22:44:21,How to incorporate the grease the grove method with a normal PPL split?,"
So I’ve been trying to get better at pull-ups (currently can do around sets of 4 at a time), and I see a lot of people saying that the best way to improve pull-ups is a grease the groove method. So just doing like 10-15 sets of 2 pull-ups a day. 
However right now my workout routine is a PPL split in the gym (some calisthenics but mostly weightlifting). I usually start my pull days with pull-ups then go on to lat pulldowns, cable rows, biceps etc.

So how would I incorporate the grease the grove method into my program? Do I do 10-15 sets of 2 pull-ups everyday at home and then just not do pull-ups at the gym? 
Will doing grease the groove while continuing my PPL split ruin my recovery as I’m not taking any complete rest day for my pulling muscles?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated :)",Fitness,"How to incorporate the grease the grove method with a normal PPL split?-

2023-04-02 02:38:53,Target heart rate zone?,"I’m in good shape - working out several times a week (tennis, hiking, running, yoga).  

However I’d like to lose 5-10 pounds and looking for guidance on the best target heart rate zone?  I will also be watching calories but wondering if it’s better to do longer, lower zone workouts? Or more HIIT type workouts?  Would love to hear from others what has worked for you. 

Thanks!

** UPDATE ** 
Thanks all. To add some more detail - I am using a calorie tracking app (LoseIt) and I understand about creating a calorie deficit to lose weight. I was posting to this group in particular b/c I’ve never focused on target heart rate for fat loss and was curious about if others have or had not success with this approach (vs just cardio). I can see my heart rate through my Apple Watch so this isn’t a question about how to measure but more about what’s most effective

As an example - you can see this in this WEBMD article where they talk about the “fat burning zone”.  Curious if others have found the heart rated target workouts to be effective or just focus more on the overall calories burned/deficit.  Thanks!

Fat-burning zone. Also called the temperate zone, you're using 60% to 70% of your maximum heart rate when exercising at this intensity. Typically, about 65% of the calories you burn in this zone are from fat.

2023-04-02 01:36:52,Gym advice for a newbie please :),"Hey guys!

I'm relatively new to the gym and want some advice please :)

A bit about me: I'm 24, 170cm (5'7), and 70kg (154lb). My goals are to:

1. Lose weight (especially around my tummy and legs)
2. Grow my bum hehe

I currently have a 4 day a week program that I wrote myself:

Day 1: Barbell squats (4x8), hip abduction machine (3x12), barbell hip thrusts (3x12), assisted pull-up machine (working towards doing pull-ups by myself), incline dumbbell press (3x8)

Day 2: Barbell deadlifts (4x8), split squats (3x8), back extension (feel awkward doing this one, would like to swap this one out), pushups on smith machine (working towards doing normal pushups), kneeling row machine (3x8), leg extension abs (3x8)

Day 3 (cardio day): Rower (3x1min), Stairmaster (3 sets of 1 minute double steps + 1 minute single steps), treadmill (2 sets of 200m, 4 incline, 9km-->300m, 0 incline, 12km-->150m, 0 incline, 6km), treadmill (30 minutes, 12 incline, 4.8km)

Day 4: Box squats (4x8), step ups (3x8), back extension (would like to swap this out), kneeling pull down machine (3x8), toe tap plank (3x10), decline abs (4x8)

Would love some advice on the following:

1. I just started full time work so I was thinking about splitting my cardio day among the 3 weights day to save me a trip to the gym each week - what do you think?
2. Are there any big exercises I'm missing that would help me achieve my 2 goals?
3. Does collagen protein help with weight loss/ build muscle as whey protein does? I just bought some protein water powder (BSC Collagen Protein Water) and the nutrition just seems too good: 368kj/88cals for 20.5g protein.
4. Would appreciate just any advice or tips please :)

Now I want to add more exercises to individual muscle group while staying at 3 days full split workout plan.

I am not sure how to work this out. Have had couple of ideas but none seems to make sense. I want to divide by Chest/Back - Bicep/Tricep - Shoulders/Legs workouts. My question to you is: is it more advantageous to add few workouts each day for each muscle groups while staying at full body split or completely isolate these muscle groups in 3 days coming out of full body split? I am finding it really difficult to add few exercises in a full body split program as well. If, as a beginner, the former option is more advantageous, how should I plan my workouts?

P.S. I can only do 3 days per week.

Thank you so much for your help!

Current Routine:
Day 1: Lat pulldown / Bench Press / Standing Overhead Press / Seated Bicep Curl / Hamstring Curls / Barbell Squat / Side delt raises

2023-04-02 00:06:22,Bad workout today,"Hey guys, I just had a pretty depressing workout today. I couldn't do as many reps or lift amounts of weight that I have previously considered normal or somewhat easy. Whenever I was halfway into my normal set for any given workout I would just lose my strength and my muscles would already feel like they were at failing point. I adjusted and did somewhat lower weight and less reps at a time but still completed most of my sets in segments.

  Last gym session was similar but I had gotten sick and then went on vacation so that was why that session was so bad. I've only started working out steadily for 2-3 months or so and when I first started I was seeing steady progress and was feeling a lot stronger. I now feel so weak and it's freaking me out.

I’m hoping you can help me understand something. I was lifting 3x a week before getting Covid. I got hit hard, and am just getting back to the gym 30 days later.

I haven’t maintained any protein goals (typically I aim for 120g a day, over Covid it was more like 40-60). I was 140 before and am still 140… but with less muscle and more fat.

That being said - do I need to start strength training again from square 1? Bicep curls w 5lb weights, etc.?

2023-04-01 15:50:31,Why is my grip strength like this?," I (16M) am really skinny and quite weak, but my grip strength is surprisingly strong and I really want to know why. I've begun to go to the gym and noticed that my grip strength was quite a lot stronger than other people my age and started wondering why.

The reason I am so invested in finding out is because I had a similar situation with my legs too: for all my life I had very muscular and built legs without even stepping foot in a gym, and it turns out it was due to me walking on my tip-toes virtually all the time (as well as some other factors). So, I imagine it is a similar situation with my grip, but I haven't been able to think of any obvious reasons why it is like it is. I have very weak arms and have never frequently lifted anything heavy before in my life (meaning a manual labor job or sport).

I have thought of some small factors that could come into play that I will describe now. Such as, my tendency to hang off of things like bars and objects in a playground and in the house as a child, but that didn't happen frequently. I also might have a minor form of hyper mobility in my joints as I can also easily bend my fingers in ways others find weird and hard to do. This hasn't been professionally diagnosed as it hasn't made any major difference to my everyday life. I was also frequently told that I was ""double-jointed"" by my family as a child.

I understand that ""good genetics"" could also play a major part but as far as I'm concerned, no one else in my family has good grip strength at all. On top of that, I don't think genetics would be the only reason as it doesn't feel achievable by just being born with it.

2023-04-01 15:11:09,I always do this.,"I (54m) decide to get in shape and lose weight. But as my diet/weight loss progresses, I begin to shift my emphasis to building muscle and looking better. This slows my weight loss to a crawl. So I'm slowly building muscle because I don't eat enough to truly do it right, AND I lose my weight/ fat loss progress because I stop truly prioritizing it as well. I eventually wind up injuring something trying too hard with my strength training and lose all progress, every time. 
First time was shoulders (didn't know about the importance of balancing out the shoulder development). Couldn't bench without serious pain for years. So I stopped working out altogether. Still have some pain there. 
Second time was an unresolved hip/pelvis injury that destroyed my mobility and had me in pain every day for a DECADE. (Didn't know about hip flexors, didn't balance quad vs hamstring development)
Third time was torn meniscus (menisci ?) on both knees (didn't know that leg extensions are not highly recommended, and must be set up correctly to perform safely)
I'm trying to learn from my failures, but still drifting off target towards muscle building. As a result, I'm sitting here having missed 2 days (usually do 6 days per week) due to knee, elbow, ankle, trap, and back pain that all stem from overdoing it with strength training. 
It has become very evident that knowledge of anatomy/physiology, and control of ego to minimize injury, are every bit as important as physical effort and diet.

I’ve come a long way on my fitness joyrney since then - I’m much healthier and in good shape. But here are the problems I face now (and I’m sure a lot of people face them as well..) 

1. I still need to lose some fat and the most stubborn fat is in my love handles. No matter how much cardio I do, it never goes.
2. As far as diet is concerned, I’m on intermittent fasting - I only consume eggs and vegetarian food. 
3. Lately, I’ve been demotivated to hit the gym because I haven’t been seeing results and I feel so guilty about it. I almost need someone to kick me in the ass and drag me to the gym. Please give me some motivation/ideas because I don’t wanna be fat again.

Any comment/advice/idea is appreciated. Help a guy out on his journey to become the best version of himself please. 🥹

2023-04-01 04:31:05,How much walking should I do each day to lose weight effectively?,"I’m obese, and I’m a beginner to fitness. I started walking every day and I‘ve put myself on a calorie deficit of roughly 1,200-1,500 calories a day (I don’t keep very good track of it to be honest), eating healthy Whole Foods such as fruits, veggies, almonds, beans and chicken. I can walk up to a maximum of 2 hours at a time before I feel like I’m going to collapse. I’ve worked myself up consistently to walking an hour, once or twice a day.

While that might sound all well and good, the problem is with this much walking, I get ravenously hungry and usually resort to binge eating and the next day I gain a little weight. To avoid this, I am thinking tomorrow I should try 30 minutes twice a day and see how well the results are. But if I can keep up walking an hour 1-2 times a day, maybe I should keep that pace? If you can offer any advice on this, I’d really appreciate it.

I keep a log of how much weight I’ve gained/lost, how much exercising I’m doing and what I eat when I binge every day so if you have any further questions let me know. I also have a cheap smart watch which helps me stay on track.",Fitness,"How much walking should I do each day to lose weight effectively?-I’m obese, and I’m a beginner to fitness.

2023-04-01 04:18:33,Questions about chest muscle and development,"I've been working out on generally my body for 6 months now and have been seeing amazing progress, I often do hard chest workouts and have been seeing good progression, but I have a little issue that is bothering me. Within my chest muscle, I can tell that its muscle and that its still small but the issue is that it looks very flabby for chest muscle. 

When I originally started working out, I had no gyno and I am confident to say I still definitely do not have gyno, I've never been obese nor have I ever had hormonal imbalance issues or eating problems. But my chest muscle is growing, and since it lacks definition it makes my chest look flabby. Though recently my eating habits haven't been the overall healthiest I still eat healthy foods, I really just eat like a normal person but my diet is primarily fruits and meats and dairy. Just for extra measure, I can tell that this isn't fat because whenever I move my arms I can see some movement near my chest and generally there are sometimes minor twitches in my inner chest, still can't tell if that is a result of arm movement or if it just happens though, and for extra note my chest only looks like this when my arms are in a total resting position, whenever an arm is raised my chest looks perfectly normal and flat as per usual.  


I have a body fat around 14-18%, generally just asking for some answers and possibly advice. I would like to look at my progress in the mirror without thinking ""that doesn't look healthy at all"" so if anyone could provide  information or advice I'd be grateful, thanks.",Fitness,"Questions about chest muscle and development-I've been working out on generally my body for 6 months now and have been seeing amazing progress, I often do hard chest workouts and have been seeing good progression, but I have a little issue that is bothering me.

I definitely have love handles and some flab up front. 

 I've been doing a ton of reading and researching for workouts and specific things I should train for everybody suggests Hiking, hiking with weights, running, core training, leg days

Im not physically active apart from being on my feet all day in boots. I'm having a hard time figuring out where to start and creating a plan. 

Such as what days to run, what days to hike, what days to train legs. Because I know you should let the portion of your body that you trained rest. Obviously it probably wouldn't be wise to hike then run or train legs the next day? Though I could be wrong. 

I was thinking of starting off by running for 30 minutes every morning before work, then walking to work with a weighted vest (it's 1.5 miles from my house) and slightly hilly. 
I live in a small mountain town in California in El Dorado County so we have plenty of trails and hills.. any input or help would be appreciated..so far this is what I have.

My goals are overall fitness and getting better at wheelchair racing and sit skiing, which I do totally casually but love. 

I have an incomplete T4 spinal cord injury which in my case means I have full arm, chest and upper back control along with a tiny bit of my lats but no abs or legs whatsoever. That makes a lot of exercises impossible or very difficult, for example I can't keep my body stable on a bench - I pretty much just roll off it, and sitting back up from it is impossible. I'm kinda nervous about free weights anyway; perhaps irrationally, but I'm paranoid that  I'm going to drop them over my head or onto my legs and cause more damage than I've already got. So I end up wandering around the strength machines and basically using whatever is free, though I use the cables a fair bit too but again I really have no clue what I'm doing with them.

I've been looking for arm and chest workouts and I've found that a lot of the exercises actually do require working legs or abs, I've tried a bunch of different workout websites and apps but either they don't let me specify what I can and can't do or are totally custom so I'm just as lost as I am at the gym!

2023-03-28 02:43:05,Mixed modalities,"The wiki has routines for different types of focus - running, strength, body weight, swimming, etc. I’m at the point of having trained different things that I want to start mixing the modalities more regularly. This is to be more rounded and less injury prone while being more fun - I’d prioritize strength 50%, and otherwise try to be well rounded; I’d be happy if I’m on a positive path in all the areas (speed of progress isn’t super important). Question is - how to properly do this?

I will probably retain a strength training base of 2 days a week (M+F), heavy compounds - squat/dl/press/pull on a two week rotation; on these days also work C&J/Snatch technique at low weight. Then body weight training on Wed with some gymnastics skills work. T/Th will be running/sports. Active recovery with yoga on Saturday.

Then body weight training on Wed with some gymnastics skills work. T/Th will be running/sports. Active recovery with yoga on Saturday.

Has anyone put together their own schedule like this? Any concerns about training frequency? Happy to accept links or examples of successful, similar routines!"

My question is (and I mean no disrespect), do we really only take our sets to failure ONCE a day? I say that because I'm used to working out 5x/week (done even 6x/week before) and taking almost all sets to failure. It's just a little counter intuitive for me that I can go from 5x/week taking most sets to failure to 3x/week just 1 set/day to failure and still make gains.

2023-03-20 18:46:06,Crosstraining Running and Lifting,"Does anyone have any tips for crosstraining running and lifting? 

I’ve been lifting consistently for about a year now. I’ve switched programs twice but right now I’m on a 4-day push-pull-legs-arms split w/ LISS cardio on my 3 rest days.

I’d really like to step back into running, and potentially train for a half marathon. I’ve tried picking up running a few times (I come from a running family), but always end up with injuries and setbacks (little bit of pushing myself too hard, combined with genetically weak ankles).

I don’t think my current 4-day split is sustainable while also running enough to see noticeable improvement; since my current split is focused on hypertrophy, I’m usually *gassed* by the end of the week.

For context, I’m 6’2” and around 200lbs. I’m pretty comfortable where I am strength-wise so I’m not terribly concerned with gaining mass, which would be near impossible while running enough to train for a half effectively.

Does anyone else cross train this way and provide any tips on how I can stay around my current weight/muscle mass while also building running endurance? I’ve read about 2-3 full-body workouts/week being effective, but if anyone has any other ideas I’d love to hear them.

Thanks for reading!

I’d really like to step back into running, and potentially train for a half marathon. I’ve tried picking up running a few times (I come from a running family), but always end up with injuries and setbacks (little bit of pushing myself too hard, combined with genetically weak ankles).

I don’t think my current 4-day split is sustainable while also running enough to see noticeable improvement; since my current split is focused on hypertrophy, I’m usually *gassed* by the end of the week.

For context, I’m 6’2” and around 200lbs. I’m pretty comfortable where I am strength-wise so I’m not terribly concerned with gaining mass, which would be near impossible while running enough to train for a half effectively.

Does anyone else cross train this way and provide any tips on how I can stay around my current weight/muscle mass while also building running endurance? I’ve read about 2-3 full-body workouts/week being effective, but if anyone has any other ideas I’d love to hear them.

Thanks for reading!

2023-03-19 15:24:50,What kind of training/trainer should I go for starting my fitness journey (again),"TL;DR: I don't trust LA/Esp*rta personal trainers or any big box gym. Am I too novice to see a powerlifting coach? 

I feel like I trust ""specialty"" trainers more than the generic ones. I also want to have fun working out again which is what I like about powerlifting/body building style training. I know discipline is critical to maintaining a good lifestyle but the fun of doing/being more is unmatched.

HISTORY: So I was a gym rat in my late teens/early 20s and I feel like I've forgotten how to do everything. I loved lifting and I used to get help with training from the friends/coworkers at the gym I worked at. But other than that it was mostly all self taught or just doing whatever my friends routines were that day which I would adopt as my own on solo days.

CURRENT: I'm a nurse commuting to a major hospital about 45-60 mins away so distance for a good gym/ trainer isn't an issue for me. That being said, I'm verrrrryyyy busy and on my feet for 14 + hours 3-4 days a week. I am on ADHD medication and forget to eat on work days (seriously I'II eat a banana, a coffee, and a cake pop in a day). So I need help with diet and exercise. I also feel that my weight gain over the years has significantly limited my ability to do the routines I did before. My scoliosis has also progressed as well but my insurance doesn’t kick in until June so I’m SOL until then. I definitely have a right shoulder sag because of it so that would also have to be factored in until I can see PT about it.

MY GOALS/NEEDS:
- Trainer equipped with knowledge about form modifications r/t scoliosis, diet plans r/t medication induced anorexia*
- Overall health improvement (improve cardiac function, energy levels, hormone balance)
- Routines that accommodate my schedule (3-4 day split maybe?)
- I am motivated but I lose “hope” easily if I’m not being guided or given timelines/metrics to achieve

*Not to be confused with the psychological illness. I have no issues eating anything (besides dairy and gluten). I take Adderall which completely blocks feelings of hunger bc it’s a stimulant. “You know you need to eat, why not just eat even if you’re not feeling hungry bc of your medicine?” I get nauseous even thinking about trying to eat on my medication. I will pick food up, take a bite or two, and immediately have to put it down bc I can barely swallow the bites I took. This is what I mean about anorexia.  
 
I feel I have come to a point where intervention is needed because I am unable to self start/sustain myself in way that isn’t painful or efficient given my needs. Who/what should I look for in a trainer? Will “specialty” trainers be a waste/willing to work with me despite no current interest in competing? I am commuting to the Tampa, FL area if anyone has any specific suggestions.",Fitness,"What kind of training/trainer should I go for starting my fitness journey (again)-TL;DR: I don't trust LA/Esp*rta personal trainers or any big box gym.

2023-03-13 13:44:46,"I've been running consistently for 8 months and my VO2Max has remained abysmal, ~21. What am I doing wrong? Why can't I get healthy?","8 months ago, I started running 3-4 times a week for about 30 minutes per session. Though I've improved the amount of time I can run for (from 30 seconds to 5+ minutes) my VO2Max has remain absolutely horrible. I measured it this morning via the Cooper test and was only able to cover 0.9miles in 12 minutes.

My heart rate is 180-200bpm throughout my 4.5mph jog. Maybe interestingly, my heart rate recovery is fairly decent, around 40bpm.

&#x200B;

I'd REALLY like to have good cardiovascular fitness, that's why I started this journey last year. Why can't I improve my vo2max score??

&#x200B;

EDIT/update: I think with the info I've gotten from this tread I'm going to create another appointment with a doctor, ask them to do a stress test and for a referral to a cardiologist.

While I wait for that appointment, I'm going to try to implement a polarized training where I'm spending 80% of my time at low intensity. And I'm going to try to not just let my HR creep up so far when I ""go hard"" in the 90-95%MHR range. I think this just means slowing down for me, even though I'm already going what seems to be a slow rate for me. I think I need to slow down further. Even though 4mph might be considered a jog, it gets my heart rate into a hard-working range, so I'm not going to overthink wording right now.

That said, it's still concerning to me, as you've all pointed out, that my heartrate is pushing its peak at 4.5mph. I'm going to see another doctor and try to bring up stress tests.

I’ve been struggling with *major* motivational issues when it comes to actually getting myself to start working out, but its something that needs to happen. The main problem is that I feel like have no clue what I’m doing even after watching a million videos and researching over the years and hate walking into an open gym fending for myself while feeling like everyones watching me. It’d be awesome if I could afford a personal trainer, but I can’t. A place like Orange Theory or joining YMCA where I can join classes and work out in a group setting with an instructor sounds very appealing. Anyone have experience with both? Pro’s/cons/recs?

2023-02-19 19:47:05,Front Squats - What are the cues for correct bar placement on shoulders?,"Hi,

I'm trying to use front squats as a substitute exercise (home gym workouts) and I just can't seem to get the bar placement correct with the front rack grip.

I've watched countless videos on it but for some reason, no matter what I do, the bar always feels as if it's on the verge of rolling forwards. I'm making a conscious effort to try to keep my elbows level but the setup just feels wrong before I even get to starting the reps.

I don't have great wrist flexibility (or flexibility in general) either so I have tried using straps temporarily to at least attempt to get the bar sitting right, but even then I find myself supporting the bar far too much with my arms instead of my shoulders. Without straps the issue is very apparent as a LOT of pressure is put on my wrists due to my shoulders not providing adequate support.

I'm of a slimmer build (if it makes any difference?!) and it's almost as if it feels impossible to bring my shoulders forwards enough to even get close to having a stable platform. I've also tried tilting my head back slightly and really forcing the bar as far as comfortable into my neck but no joy.

Has anyone else experienced this and found a workaround?",Fitness,"Front Squats - What are the cues for correct bar placement on shoulders?-Hi,

2023-02-18 02:21:44,Exercise makes me want to cry…,"Quick background: (42years old). I am plus size, but was very fit a few years ago doing duathlons, triathlon, (was plus size then too). 

But in 2020 I went through breast cancer treatments. I’m fine now, but between that and some other major life events, I have let my health go. I got into the habit of napping a lot during chemo treatments and I can’t break the habit now. I feel tired all the time. (For the record I am in therapy and are on supportive meds). I know part of this is that the napping ruins my ability to sleep at night and it’s just a vicious cycle.

I know exercising will give me more energy. But every time I’ve tried to get back to it, I get this deep sadness and I just want to go to bed and cry. 

I’m just confused and am wondering if anyone else has gone through something similar. I want to be active again, but even baby steps seem too hard.",Fitness,"Exercise makes me want to cry…-Quick background: (42years old).

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.

You can sign up for the daily email here: https://schwarzenegger.ck.page/ff81cbf258, and get an ebook with some beginner at home and hardcore from my old days workouts. It’s all free and will always be free, but if I’m not allowed to post it tell me and I’ll delete the link and just answer your questions. Let’s see what you’ve got. Bring it on!

THANKS EVERYBODY! I think I answered 100 questions, it’s been 5 hours, and if I don’t walk away I never will. Sign up for the newsletter at the link above for daily no-nonsense advice like this, and that ebook has some good motivation of my lowest moments and my method for setting goals.

I said in one answer but I’ll add it here. I love these Q and A’s. I want to make it a weekly feature in the newsletter, and I want the questions to come from Reddit because the conversation here is just better. You tell me the best way, because you’re all better with the machines than me. 

Keep pumping.

Update: did another round this morning after I fed the animals. It’s addictive. I know I told multiple people not to use social media before the gym because we shared the study in the newsletter that it decreases strength, but I don’t think this counts because I feel good.

Post-gym update: Even though I am still going, a lot of these questions can be answered by just clicking that link. At home workouts come once a week to our newsletter subscribers, and I shared one here in an answer!

2023-02-05 16:25:19,SO and I have different goals. How do I manage meals at home/grocery shopping/cooking/etc?,"Hi! My SO and I will be moving in together very soon. This means eating the same meals (in a way) and cooking together, etc. however, this is causing some concern for me.

I was previously very overweight and lost 50 pounds between 2019-2020. Since then, I’ve been maintaining my weight by practicing healthier eating habits (eating when I’m hungry, listening to my body, generally smaller portions, lighter calorie alternatives to things like sauces, drinks, etc). I go to the gym, exercise and do all of these things to manage my weight and keep it at a healthy level, which helps me feel my best. 

My SO, however, is in a very different situation. They go to the gym in order to get bigger, build up muscle, and gain weight. As a result, they find themselves looking to eat more food and consume higher calorie meals (full/higher calorie options, supplements, extra meals, etc) to match their needs.


When we move in together, how can we ensure we are still both eating meals that help us reach our goals? Should I focus on smaller portions and they focus on larger portions of the same meal? Should we focus on having slightly different foods made from many of the same ingredients? What are other options for helping us both meet our wellness goals while eating and living together? Anyone who can share experience with this situation or advice on how to navigate it, I would be so thankful!!

2023-01-30 14:59:43,Does overtraining exist? (research review),"###**Intro**

Not everyone thinks overtraining is real. Public personalities such as CT Fletcher and the late Rich Piana spoke against the existence of overtraining.

**You may have heard phrases such as:**

- “More is better”

- “Push yourself to your limits”

- “There is no such thing as overtraining, only under recovery”

**Even coaches question the existence of overtraining:**

- “I haven’t seen anyone experience [overtraining]” [2]

- “Is it overtraining or just work ethic?” [2]

These claims hold some truth. Indeed, it is very hard to become overtrained, also known as overtraining syndrome. It mostly happens to elite athletes. It is rare in strength training and bodybuilding [1] [7].

Many scientific studies describe overtraining syndrome in athletes [1] [4] [5] [6] [7] [9]. Estimates suggest 20% to 60% of athletes may become overtrained at some point in their career [4]. 

###**What overtraining is**

Overtraining is when you’ve pushed your body too hard for too long [1] [4] [5] [6] [7] [9].

In practice, you experience a drop in physical performance and fatigue [4] [7] [9] [11].

**There are two things that lead to overtraining:**

1. Excessive exercise: for example, intense training every day [7].

2. Under recovery: not enough food, water, physical rest, mental rest and sleep [7] [9].

You need to do both of these for months, maybe years, until overtraining develops.

In other words, overtraining is all about balance, or the lack of it.

###**Under recovery, not just over training**

While it may seem contradictory, overtraining doesn’t have to come exclusively from excessive exercise.

Under recovery  means eating, sleeping or resting too little. It also includes mental stress.

So if you do not recover properly, you may end up ""under recovered"".

###**Will I become overtrained?**

I think the /r/fitness wiki [answers this well](https://thefitness.wiki/faq/am-i-overtraining/): No 

The risk of overtraining syndrome is low. You are more likely to become overreached or non-functionally overreached. The symptoms during overreaching are the same as during overtraining: fatigue, drop in performance, and so on.

The ones who are at a real risk of overtraining, are elite athletes. It could happen to a normal person, but that person would have to train daily, intensively, for months and years.

###**Conclusion**

Overtraining syndrome exists, but you are not likely to be affected by it.

If you recover with 1-4 weeks of rest, you are overreaching. If you need 4+ weeks of recovery, you may be overtrained.

I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND that users set up a Dropbox account (it's free!), and use the app on their mobile devices in combination with the Android/iOS versions of Excel. It works flawlessly for me.

Probably the #1 question I get asked. Do I ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY need Excel on the desktop in order to use this spreadsheet / for it to work?

Short answer, yes, and no. I developed it on Excel for the Desktop, and I do my testing to ensure that things behave in that environment.

While you *can* use this with the web version of Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice, etc., I do not *recommend* it, as I did not create it for those platforms. Please see [https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/10zb7pr/comment/j8a5wf3/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/10zb7pr/comment/j8a5wf3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for very specific workarounds that you will have to do in order for things to work. YMMV.

This is my first post here, even though I have been reading/watching fitness content for almost 8 years now. I have a passion for fitness and my goal is to have an aesthetic lean and healthy body. I am 28 years old, male, 184 cm, and at around 80 kg right now (6’0’’ and 176 lbs for fellow Americans). I know this journey is a long one and I am not claiming I know much, so happy to get any feedback from you guys.

HIGH PROTEIN DIET BUT NO SERIOUS LIFTING (2015-2019):

While studying at university, I had casually started going to the gym with my buddies, learning a bit about nutrition and working out. I gradually understood the importance of protein and calorie intake, progressive overload, rest and sleep, having a routine and being disciplined. With ups and downs, I would have periods when I would focus more on my workouts and stressful periods where I would not progress at all because I would not spend much time at the gym. I was around 86-88 kg for the whole period and my aim was to lose 5-6 kg, build some muscle and become more fit.

HOME WORKOUTS/COVID (2020)

During the COVID-19 lockdowns, having plenty of free time, I started working out at home, mainly doing pushups and when I had access to some outdoors bars I would do pull-ups/leg raises/dips. When I went back home and I had access to the sea I would also go swimming almost every day. Nothing crazy, just for 10-15 minutes.

2021-2022 GYMS REOPEN

In 2021, I would casually go back to the gym, more chilled with my nutrition, enjoying desserts and fatty foods here and there. I would walk for at least 1 hour a day (commute and back) so I would still lose some weight and finally become around 80-82 kg.

2023 FITNESS BECOMES PRIORITY

This January I decided to sign up to a new gym with a sauna, swimming pool and steam room and accepted a challenge by a friend on who can become most ripped over the next year or so. So I started reading in various subreddits on what I should do, realising at around 80 kg I need to lean bulk up first and then cut (something I never actually did, at least on purpose). So I am back into reading about workouts and nutrition, using the sauna after my morning workouts as it makes me feel good and trying to bulk in a proper way, eating healthy foods.

PROGRAM

I chose to mix compound exercises with isolation exercises so that each day is focused around at least one main muscle group. One of the reasons I am posting this is to get feedback about my program. I feel like I started with a proper program and over the years I customised it so many times so that I am adaptable to what’s available in the gym and to what I feel like doing on that day. I work out 6-7 days a week so I am targeting most muscle groups more than once in a week. For most exercises, I would have a dynamic warm-up first (small or no weight) and then start the actual sets. Over time, I am increasing the weight, to achieve progressive overload or add extra reps/sets in my workout.  I occasionally have an intense 15-minute ab workout with very small breaks, targeting upper abs, lower abs and obliques.

Day 1 - Chest

4 x (8 reps +) Barbell Bench Press (from just the bar warm-up to 90kg)

4 x (8 reps +) Dips with just bodyweight

4x (8 reps +) Dumbbell Incline Bench Press (up to 34 kg per hand)

3x (8 reps +) Cable fly from above

3x (8 reps +) Cable fly from mid-height

3x (8 reps +) Cable fly from low-height

Day 2- Back

6x (6-8 reps) Pull Ups (just bodyweight)

3x (8 reps +) Dumbbell Row (16 kg each hand separately)

3x (8 reps +) Barbell Row (up to 50 kg)

4x (8 reps+) Lat pulldown machines

Day 3 - Legs

5x (8-10 reps) Romanian Deadlifts (up to 80 kg)

4x (8-10 reps) Squats (~~up to 60 kg~~ \- need to increase this) EDIT: 90kg recorded [myself](https://imgur.com/LCIlqyD) this morning feeling energetic and after reading comments was not afraid to increase weight (let me know what you think of the form)

4x (8-10 reps) Leg Extensions (45 kg)

4x (8-10 reps) Leg Curl (around 25 kg)

Day 4 - Shoulders/Biceps/Triceps

4x (8 reps) Barbell Overhead press (up to 50 kg)

5x (8 reps) Dumbbell Side lateral raise (up to 12 kg per hand)

4x (8 reps + ) front raises with a 15 kg round weight

4x (8 reps +) Hammer Curls (up to 16 kg per hand)

4x (8 reps +) Dumbbell Bicep Curls (up to 20 kg per hand)

4x (8 reps +) Tricep Extensions (up to 10 kg per hand)

4x (8 reps +) Tricep Dips (just bodyweight)

4x (8 reps) rear delt fly (small weight - e.g. 5 kg)

DIET

I started tracking macros and calories via MyNetDiary. I use my apple watch which is synced with the app to adjust the calorie budget depending on my daily activity. Working out every day, I need around 3.3k kcal for maintenance or 3.5k kcal for a 0.5 kg gain per month. I use the rule of thumb of having up to 2g of protein for each kg of my body weight, so my goal is to have around 160g of protein every day. I prefer foods low on saturated fats and I minimise red meat consumption. The macro split on a typical day would be 20% protein, 20% fat and 60% carbs. I find this well balanced with my goals and the high amount of carbs makes me feel energetic in my workouts. This is still my first week tracking so I need to do some trial and error so that I achieve the desired result.

My most popular meals are (I would sometimes have breakfast/lunch twice in a day):

Breakfast: (44g protein/580kcal) Protein scoop, 55g oats, 50g blueberries, one banana, 100g 5% fage Greek yoghurt

Lunch: (54g protein/630kcal)250g Brown rice (microwaved for 2 mins) + 220g chicken breast

Dinner: Homemade pizza (47g protein/1000kcal)

SUPPLEMENTS: Whey/vegan protein powder and protein bars to boost protein intake (and coffee for pre-workout!).

END

Thank you for spending your time reading all this. I know I had very slow progress in the first few years with almost non-existent progress until 2020, but I think what matters is the way forward, so happy to hear your thoughts. Writing this was helpful for me, gathering my thoughts and reflecting on areas to improve. I am the happiest I have even been and feeling healthy and confident with my body, and this was not always the case. I hope this can help others in their own journeys.

I feel like I started with a proper program and over the years I customised it so many times so that I am adaptable to what’s available in the gym and to what I feel like doing on that day. I work out 6-7 days a week so I am targeting most muscle groups more than once in a week. For most exercises, I would have a dynamic warm-up first (small or no weight) and then start the actual sets. Over time, I am increasing the weight, to achieve progressive overload or add extra reps/sets in my workout.  I occasionally have an intense 15-minute ab workout with very small breaks, targeting upper abs, lower abs and obliques.

Day 1 - Chest

4 x (8 reps +) Barbell Bench Press (from just the bar warm-up to 90kg)

4 x (8 reps +) Dips with just bodyweight

4x (8 reps +) Dumbbell Incline Bench Press (up to 34 kg per hand)

3x (8 reps +) Cable fly from above

3x (8 reps +) Cable fly from mid-height

3x (8 reps +) Cable fly from low-height

Day 2- Back

6x (6-8 reps) Pull Ups (just bodyweight)

3x (8 reps +) Dumbbell Row (16 kg each hand separately)

3x (8 reps +) Barbell Row (up to 50 kg)

4x (8 reps+) Lat pulldown machines

Day 3 - Legs

5x (8-10 reps) Romanian Deadlifts (up to 80 kg)

4x (8-10 reps) Squats (~~up to 60 kg~~ \- need to increase this) EDIT: 90kg recorded [myself](https://imgur.com/LCIlqyD) this morning feeling energetic and after reading comments was not afraid to increase weight (let me know what you think of the form)

4x (8-10 reps) Leg Extensions (45 kg)

4x (8-10 reps) Leg Curl (around 25 kg)

Day 4 - Shoulders/Biceps/Triceps

4x (8 reps) Barbell Overhead press (up to 50 kg)

5x (8 reps) Dumbbell Side lateral raise (up to 12 kg per hand)

4x (8 reps + ) front raises with a 15 kg round weight

4x (8 reps +) Hammer Curls (up to 16 kg per hand)

4x (8 reps +) Dumbbell Bicep Curls (up to 20 kg per hand)

4x (8 reps +) Tricep Extensions (up to 10 kg per hand)

4x (8 reps +) Tricep Dips (just bodyweight)

4x (8 reps) rear delt fly (small weight - e.g. 5 kg)

DIET

I started tracking macros and calories via MyNetDiary. I use my apple watch which is synced with the app to adjust the calorie budget depending on my daily activity. Working out every day, I need around 3.3k kcal for maintenance or 3.5k kcal for a 0.5 kg gain per month. I use the rule of thumb of having up to 2g of protein for each kg of my body weight, so my goal is to have around 160g of protein every day. I prefer foods low on saturated fats and I minimise red meat consumption. The macro split on a typical day would be 20% protein, 20% fat and 60% carbs. I find this well balanced with my goals and the high amount of carbs makes me feel energetic in my workouts. This is still my first week tracking so I need to do some trial and error so that I achieve the desired result.

My most popular meals are (I would sometimes have breakfast/lunch twice in a day):

Breakfast: (44g protein/580kcal) Protein scoop, 55g oats, 50g blueberries, one banana, 100g 5% fage Greek yoghurt

Lunch: (54g protein/630kcal)250g Brown rice (microwaved for 2 mins) + 220g chicken breast

Dinner: Homemade pizza (47g protein/1000kcal)

SUPPLEMENTS: Whey/vegan protein powder and protein bars to boost protein intake (and coffee for pre-workout!).

END

Thank you for spending your time reading all this. I know I had very slow progress in the first few years with almost non-existent progress until 2020, but I think what matters is the way forward, so happy to hear your thoughts. Writing this was helpful for me, gathering my thoughts and reflecting on areas to improve. I am the happiest I have even been and feeling healthy and confident with my body, and this was not always the case. I hope this can help others in their own journeys.

2023-01-26 21:56:20,Remaining disciplined when you reach comfort,"In September 2022 I was 280 lbs and had a horrible diet and lifestyle but I had these 2 friends who were continuously asking me to come to the gym with them. After a few weeks, I decided that I might aswell and just went. From then to the start of this year, I’ve been counting calories, going to the gym 5 days a week and running 6 days a week. I’m now around 220lbs and I’m constantly getting people tell me that I’ve done so well and they can’t believe how much weight I’ve lost and when one person asked me how much more I want to lose and I told them at least another 20 lbs, they said I didn’t have that on my body to lose. Now, my problem is that even though, I still look at myself and know how far I am from where I want to be, I’m becoming less and less disciplined with my diet and my exercise and it might be due to these comments. Kind of like the famous Marvin Hagler quote “it’s hard to wake up when you’re sleeping in silk sheets”. Again, I’m fully aware that I don’t even look good but idk, being disciplined or motivated had never been hard for me until these past few weeks. That’s the back story but the question is - how do you guys keep disciplined when I’m sure some of you are in great shape? 
Thanks

Update:
Thank you to everyone who replied. I ended up getting down to 192 lbs by using some of your advice. However, I still felt too fat, didn’t have very much muscle at all and the 1200 calories was starting to become very challenging after 8 months of it haha. I’m now on the last week of my first bulk having put on 9lbs in 7 weeks. I’ll be testing my 1 rep max on the bench on Monday and if I hit it, this 7 weeks will have improved my pr 25kg.

**Diet**
My diet wasn’t anything I tracked, I had irritable bowl syndrome and one of the alternative methods of treatment I attempted on my own that I found to work wonders for me in multiple levels of this was intermittent fasting. My fasting schedule aloud me to eat 5 hours out of the day. I would front load with a dynamotized protein with extended release at the beginning of my window and at the end of my window which totaled to 120 grams of protein. I cut pop completely from consumption. I do a gallon of water At least a day. I attempt to eat every hour for the 4 hour window period I have and the results with my overall body composition as well as my IBS really did wonders. Oddly enough I did not really “track” my diet but stuck very strict to the fasting window.

I can say I have noticed a difference in the size of certain muscle groups and I am open to critique and criticism (I welcome it as I’m trying to truly take this to the next level). Things I have noticed more so than size is strength in my lower half but size really hasn’t followed. This could potentially be in part because of the fasting but I am not positive. 

My goals moving forward:

- put on more muscle and size in my quads and hamstrings 
- find a bit of an alternative diet that allows me to grow a bit as I feel I’m limiting myself size wise with the fasting but am not sure if that is the reason
- never go back to the point of walking up the stairs has me breathing heavy for awhile lol",Fitness,"22M Natural Progress photos over 2 years (chubby—> toned)-

**Diet**
My diet wasn’t anything I tracked, I had irritable bowl syndrome and one of the alternative methods of treatment I attempted on my own that I found to work wonders for me in multiple levels of this was intermittent fasting. My fasting schedule aloud me to eat 5 hours out of the day. I would front load with a dynamotized protein with extended release at the beginning of my window and at the end of my window which totaled to 120 grams of protein. I cut pop completely from consumption. I do a gallon of water At least a day. I attempt to eat every hour for the 4 hour window period I have and the results with my overall body composition as well as my IBS really did wonders. Oddly enough I did not really “track” my diet but stuck very strict to the fasting window.

Fast: 20 hours-
- only water

2023-01-21 04:21:21,help with next step on my fitness journey,"Hello all just joined this group. I think it's my first reddit!. Anyway my TLDR question, I'm looking to do a paid program that covers strength mobility and flexibility. If there are separate programs for each I'm ok with that but I'm looking for ones that are considered really top notch

The long story:
I'm 45 ,  used to be a gymnast and a wrestler when younger then just weight training for the last 2 or 3 decades! My goals are to maintain the 60 lb weight loss i just achieved over the last year as well as get back mobility and flexibility. I had an epiphany the other day that I was approaching fitness completely ass backwards. All these years of weight training got me strong,  put muscle on me , but destroyed my mobility. Not knocking weight training but I've only now realized it's a tool in the box, not the whole box. I happened upon an animal flow class and loved it, but again my joints are not used to it and my movements are restricted. So I want to really deep dive into this and make it a priority. Which brings me to my question. I'm really looking to just buy a program to make it easy for me. I really need a program that focuses on mobility as well as strength. I liked the animal flow but when I went a Googlin there are hundreds of programs for sale with no way for me to figure out which direction to go.

2023-01-20 05:54:05,is HIT ( High Intensity Training) legit?,"I've recently come across Drew Baye and Jay Vincent in Youtube.  

They claim:

\- You don't have to lift heavy or lift fast to recruit fast twitch muscle fibers. Fast twitch muscles are solely recruited by intense effort when the muscle comes close to failure. Therefore you don't need to lift fast on concentric part of the exercise.

&#x200B;

\-All you need is EXACTLY 1 SET AND EXACTLY 1 EXERCISE PER WEEK FOR EACH MUSCLE GROUP.  That set is different than traditional sets though. They are 4-6 second concentric, 4-6 second eccentric to failure. 20-30 mins of hell. 

&#x200B;

\-Going to failure in this fashion is extremely hard, beginners usually begin with drop sets because they can't really push it there. This one brutal set is not just all you need, but also all you can tolerate. Once you finish this brutal set you should not be able to rest and do a second set. That one brutal set is going to create all the damage and procedures we need for signaling muscle growth.  

&#x200B;

\-Having 2 times in a week(upper and lower) in this fashion is going to have AT MINIMUM THE SAME(IF NOT BETTER) results than 3x-5x a week.

&#x200B;

\-Doing 3+ sets are completely unneccesary. Its a lie told by Reg Park and Arnold. Back in 1940-50s, people were doing 1 set per exercise. Reg Park wanted attention so he said doing more sets will stimulate better growth and then Arnold took it to a even more extreme levels and people followed Arnold (I don't remember the complete history, it roughly starts like that).

&#x200B;

\-Full ROM is not necessary AT ALL. You can get the same results by just isometric contractions. However, doing full ROM will have neural adaptations and its more fun to do.

&#x200B;

There are many other claims, such as you don't need to train a sport-specific movement with resistance, all resistance training you need is performing basic muscle functions with resistance, then you learn the sport-specific movement without any resistance as a skill. All the strength you gain from lifting weights with basic exercises is going to be transferred as you learn the skill. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

However, only 1 set/muscle to failure, 2x times a week is the biggest claim.  It got me real confused here. Is this a legit approach? If its so, why not everyone is doing it lol?",Fitness,"is HIT ( High Intensity Training) legit?-I've recently come across Drew Baye and Jay Vincent in Youtube.

I lift for baseball and pitching and Currently when I squat I stick around sets of 3-5 with as heavy as I can get for those sets however I was wondering if I should be doing more sets of higher reps with lighter weight. Would that be more beneficial to getting more velo of the mound or should I keep sticking to strength and stay with the heavy weight for more sets. My current squat max is around 385 and my 5 rep is 310-315 and 3 rep is 335-345.",Fitness,"Should I go heavier weight with less reps on squat or lighter weight with higher reps?

**Progress Pic (arms):** [**https://imgur.com/2Mq8Qqb**](https://imgur.com/2Mq8Qqb)

**Diet:**

*Breakfast:*

* Oatmeal with ground up walnuts and 
* 1 glass of apple juice 

*Lunch:*

* pasta, either with chicken or grated cheese
* salad 
* 2 glasses of soy milk

*Dinner:*

* Various options: chicken/fish/lentils/beans/stir-fry with paneer
* Always with Rice and sometimes an extra naan

*Snacks:*

* Yogurt with fruit

I try to aim for 2500 - 3000 cal everyday (or at least enough that fills me up and ensures I am not overeating) with 100g of protein. I am not taking creatine or steroids.

**Training:**

Since I go to the gym 4 days per week, I follow an upper-lower split. For all my exercises, I perform 3-5 sets and aim for the 5-12 rep range

*Upper:*

* Barbell bench (started with a max of 85 pounds, it is now 170 pounds)
* Incline DB bench (started with 10 pounds 3 x 10, it is now 40 pounds 3 x 10)
* DB shoulder press (started with 15 pounds 3 x 10, it is now 40 pounds 3 x 10)
* Lateral raises (just incorporated these into my routine and don't have a before/after)
* Tricep cable pushdowns  (started with 15 pounds 3 x 10, it is now 35 pounds 3 x 10)
* Overhead tricep cable extensions (started with 10 pounds 3 x 10, it is now 30 pounds 3 x 10)
* Pull ups (couldn't do 1 when first starting, now can do 10 unassisted)
* Hammer curls (started with 15 pounds 3 x 5, it is now 30 pounds 3 x 10)
* Barbell bicep curls (just incorporated these into my routine and don't have a before/after)

With my upper body, I ensure I'm hitting every muscle group, however given the large number of exercises I sometimes need to cut out 1-2 exercises when I am short on time (e.g. alternating between DB shoulder press and incline, cable pushdowns and cable extensions)

*Lower:*

* Barbell Squats (started with DB squats 20 pounds 3 x 10. My max barbell squat is now 195 pounds)
* Leg extensions (started with 50 pounds 3 x10. It is now 130 pounds 3 x 10)
* Leg press *(*started with no plates 3 x 10. It is now 370 pounds 3 x 8)
* Seated leg curl (started with 30 pounds 3 x 10. It is now 120 pounds 3 x 10)
* Standing leg curl (started with 10 pounds 3 x 10. It is now 50 pounds 3 x 8)
* Calf raises (Can't remember my before/after)

These exercises sufficiently target my quads and hamstrings. 

**Next steps**

* My goal is to bench and squat 225 by the spring.
* My lower body is weaker than my upper body, so I will continue to work hard with my legs.",Fitness,"18M Natural Transformation (Skinny to Muscle)-**Before:** age 18, 5' 11'', 135 pounds

* Standing leg curl (started with 10 pounds 3 x 10. It is now 50 pounds 3 x 8)
* Calf raises (Can't remember my before/after)

These exercises sufficiently target my quads and hamstrings. 

**Next steps**

* My goal is to bench and squat 225 by the spring.
* My lower body is weaker than my upper body, so I will continue to work hard with my legs."

2023-01-02 16:57:05,Is cardio holding me back? (high compounds),"Hi just for reference, 39 male, 6'5, 198 pounds (15-16% BF)

Just started lifting again now that my kids are old enough let me sleep enough! lol  


I've never been really fit in my life, when I first lifted weight at 18yo, I was 6'5 155pounds, and could barely bench the empty bar. I'm not a sport guy at all and usually not very active.  


I'm trying to change this up since roughly last august, my lift are increasing slowly, it's going slow but I'm getting better for sure.  


Now when it comes to high compounds particularly deadlifts and squats.. not only am I extremly weak, but my cardio is definitly lacking.  


For exemple squats, couple months ago I could barely perform proper body weight sqauats, I have slowly progressed and for now I stick to goblet squats. These days I roughly go with a 50pound dumbell, and let's say I start my set with 100BPM heart (from my galaxy watch 5), after 5-6 reps I'm already struggling, but I don't feel like it's lactic acid holding me back... I'm just totally out of breath, I'll finish a  9-10 reps set and my HR is already 165-170 BPM.. like holy hell ?  I know high compounds use a lot of muscle groups but damn!   


I've been adding more and more cardio the last month, eliptical, swimming, walking (much more than I've ever done in my life) and so far I see zero improvement.

Has there been any research on the differences in results from these two styles of machines, assuming that time and perceived effort is equivalent? What about research on muscles worked by each machine?

Do you prefer one over the other? Why?

2022-12-23 23:29:35,Study: Gut Microbiome Determines Motivation to Exercise,"Last week, a study came out showing that the amount of dopamine an animal's brain releases when they exercise depends on their gut bacteria. Microbiome composition impacted how much the animals would run, both in a forced endurance test and on an exercise wheel in their free time.

It looks like a definite cause-and-effect thing: the high-exercising trait could be transferred to other mice by transplanting their gut bacteria. 

Really wild implications for everything from diet to antibiotics--even cannabis use; it looks like the effect was mediated by the cannabinoid receptor. 

Wanted to share it here because ""mind over matter"" is a big thing, but...well, minds are made of matter, and this implies that exercise genuinely is just easier for some people than for others.

* [Here is the full run of Super Squats]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xRsOupFXRk&list=PLfcuGAffLlSdHGXZa4ER6fRyj-7FrJPuy)

* [This is the workout where I tear my hamstring on rep 20]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcxLXusOkbM) and [this is what a torn hamstring looks like]( https://i.imgur.com/CRcvYUf.jpg)


**INTRO/BACKGROUND**

* I first ran Super Squats when I was in college, well over 15 years ago…and never ran it again since.  In my mind it was one of the most effective programs of all time AND once of the most traumatic experiences of all time.  I could still remember the pain of those 20 rep sets, the anxiety that existed between workouts, and being SO happy when it was over.  I said I’d run it again some day, and had recommended the book to SO many trainees, yet took SO long to finally saddle back up and do it all over again.

* A lot had changed between then and now.  One of the biggest factors being that I had my ACL reconstructed in 2015 after rupturing it and part of my meniscus in a strongman competition.  That changes squats a little.  But I was also much smarter about training and nutrition than I was as a meathead college kid, so that’s cool.

* For the full rundown on stats, I’m 37, 5’9, bodyweight somewhere in the high 180s, have lifted weights for 23 years, competed in strongman for a decade off and on, did some powerlifting, combat sports/martial arts experience, and has accumulated some bumps and scrapes along the way.    

**WHAT SUPER SQUATS IS/IS NOT**

* First, it is NOT a squatting program.  Oh my god I hate how I have to keep explaining this.  Am I the ONLY one who got taught “Don’t judge a book by its cover?”  Same thing with the “30lbs of muscle in 6 weeks” thing: quit focusing on that.  The squatting in Super Squats is PURELY a mechanism employed to trigger muscular bodyweight growth in a trainee.  It wasn’t a program designed with “improving your squat as much as possible!” or “the surefire solution to chicken legs!”: the BREATHING squat is chosen because it’s a way to trigger full body growth.  And no: I don’t mean “it causes the release of HGH/testosterone”: I’m talking about the fact that, when you do breathing squats, you spend a LOT of time with a weight on your back, which is signaling to your body that the whole BODY needs a LOT more muscle SOON if it wants to survive.  The squatting itself adds stimulus, absolutely, but I’ve found that one can employ good mornings to a similar effect, and there’s a solid argument about being able to employ trap bar lifts as well.

* It is a SYSTEM, not a workout.  Specifically, that system is premised upon the idea of putting the entire body under SIGNIFICANT stress 2-3 times a week, and consistently upping that stress so that it’s never able to fully cope.  This is why you use the weight you’d squat for 10 to do 20 reps, and it’s why you add 5lbs per workout.  A lot of folks seem to think the magic is just in the squat set, so they’ll do a set of 20 breathing squats ONE time and go “Yeah, that was hard, but I don’t see the big deal”.  The big deal is that you have to do it AGAIN 2 days later…with 5lbs more than before…for 6 weeks.  You can’t just take the squats part of Super Squats in isolation: it’s a whole system.  It’s also why the gallon of milk a day is associated with it: it’s a system of training insanely hard and then eating VERY big so that you can be recovered enough to achieve the next goal.  It’s why when people ask “what should I do if I fail” on the program, I tell them “don’t”.  If you are actually eating as much as you need to eat and following the program, success should be your only outcome…assuming you have the necessary mental fortitude to get through it.

* [It is a BOOK](https://www.amazon.com/Super-Squats-Pounds-Muscle-Weeks/dp/0926888005).  Every time I see a trainee fail with “Super Squats”, it’s because they’re not actually doing Super Squats, because they didn’t read the book.  The book can be read in an afternoon and it’s $10 on Kindle: there’s zero excuse for not reading it.  It explains EVERYTHING.  It doesn’t just lay out a program: it walks you through step by step how to execute it, gives you instructions on how to perform ALL the exercises, it lays out a very effective nutrition protocol, it gives you psychological coaching to get through the squat set (along with saying MANY times that it’s 3 deep breaths between EVERY rep…but I digress), and even goes into the history of squatting and strong people in general, and EVEN gives you a follow-on plan so you can actually run Super Squats for QUITE a long duration.  There is a reason I practically THROW this book at every new trainee: if you read it, you will have pretty much everything you could ever need.

**MY RUN OF THE PROGRAM**

* When I began Super Squats, I was amazed at how many people who read my blog kept asking me what my plan was.  “You started at 315lbs: are you planning on going all the way to 405 for 20?”  “You’ve done 5x10x405: are you planning on going higher than 405?”  “Are you planning on making this even more challenging than the book says?”.  I kept saying the same thing: “My goal is to experience this experience”.  It was to the point that I think OTHER people were getting anxiety over my “lack of a plan”.

* Folks: CHAOS IS THE PLAN.  It’s not just a thing I say: it’s the truth.

* …and BOY was it the truth.  When I originally mapped out the 6 week block of Super Squats, I had a full 6 weeks on my schedule with uninterrupted time set out.  2 weeks before I started, my job threw a trip on my schedule from Mon through Thurs of my first week of the program.   Cool, time to call an audible.  I did the first workout on a Friday, my second workout the Monday I left for the trip, and the third workout on the Friday that I returned home.

* …except that, in between Monday and Friday, on that work trip, I came down with RSV.  On Tuesday night of that week, I did not sleep, because my fever was so high I had forgotten how to sleep.  I literally ate non-stop for 2 hours before that, because my kid had RSV before I left and they were taking FOREVER to heal because they wouldn’t eat, so I knew calories were the answer.  My appetite was shot, but that’s never slowed me down before, and, thankfully, my room was fully stocked with travel food, because I know how to travel.

* …and then I STILL did my 3rd workout on Friday, with RSV…and promptly proceeded to pull something in my innerquad/outer hamstring on my right leg on rep 15, because I forgot to factor in the significant impact of dehydration when you’ve been losing all your fluids to an awful ragged cough.  Which, if you want some real fun: try BREATHING squats with RSV.  Also: symptoms last for 2 weeks…so that’s cool.

* Whelp, Chaos it the Plan: “What Would Bruce Randall Do?”  He’d do some goddamn good mornings, and that was EXACTLY what I did.  I figured: if a dude that broke his leg in 7 places could use good mornings to build up to a 600lb squat, I could use them to get through Super Squats.  [Cue one of the hardest workouts of my life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp0RHBNFwgo)


* I kept the weight EXACTLY the same as what I failed on with the squats, because I figured THAT was the most significant part of the program.  It’s why I picked good mornings as well: it’d keep the weight ON my back in the same spot as before with the same weight as before.  

* I genuinely think that workout was so hard it scared my body into healing, because I was able to return to squatting again for the next workout.  I was in pain, sure, and I had to take the squats slow, but I wasn’t missing any reps.

* And then, like an idiot, I forgot the lessons I had learned about hydration and keeping my legs warm and, without my morning Gatorade and sweats, went and TORE my hamstring…this time on rep 20!  Yup: that was workout 7.

* Back on the good mornings, but this time the hamstring was so borked I couldn’t get the weight that I needed to for progression.  I got hurt with 345, and 350 wasn’t stable, so I warmed up until I felt the hamstring start to buckle and went for [max rep GMs]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tcuISpN63w)


* So now Chaos really IS the plan: 5lb progressions between workouts just ceased.  What is one to do?  Well, the middle of that good morning workout and my next squat workout, Thanksgiving happened, which meant I had to [pull 401 reps with 135lbs on a high handle trap bar in a single set]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWkSz-QEtSk)


* Because traditions damnit!

* Next Super Squats workout, all my hamstring would tolerate was 315lbs, so I went and took it for a ride and only managed 16 reps before I could feel it start to buckle and bulge.  So I got to yes by racking the bar, trying 1 more rep, hitting my pullovers, and then immediately getting pissed off, strip the bar to 245lbs and get my 20 reps in.  Mission absolutely accomplished. Please note my use of knee wraps to hold my hamstring in place/together, as that would be in effect for the remainder of the program.

* …and with THAT, the new way forward began.  We had finished workout 9, which was halfway through the program, and a new plan emerged: take 315 for as many reps as possible.  Which is TOTALLY in-line with something the book discussed about dudes going for 30 reps with breathing squats. Chaos is the plan, and we moved forward with that plan.

* …and comically enough, people STILL asked me what I was planning.  “Are you going to stick with 315 or eventually up the weight?”  This whole run of SS could NOT be any more an indication of “Chaos is the Plan”.  And I’M SO thankful that I embraced that from the start.  If I set out with a goal to squat 405 for 20, I’d just be miserable with how this whole experience turned out, and probably would have shut it all down at the halfway point when I “failed” to add 5lbs.  Instead, I got to experience the most challenging run of Super Squats perhaps EVER performed: afflicted with RSV for about half of it, through torn muscles, adding a rep each session and nearly blacking out from effort, with some Bruce Randall good mornings for good measure.  This is the Chaos edition of Super Squats, and it’s amazing.

* For those that want to watch the whole process, [here is the youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xRsOupFXRk&list=PLfcuGAffLlSdHGXZa4ER6fRyj-7FrJPuy)

**MY SPECIFIC TRAINING PLAN**

* The very first time I ran the program 15 years ago, I did an abbreviated approach, because that was all the rage then.  This time, I wanted to stay pretty close to what the book laid out.  I did no calf work, and my ab work was standing ab wheel, but for the most part I stuck with the program laid out in the book while employing the exercises listed.  

* I created two separate training days (A and B) and rotated between them every training day, 3x a week.  Do, for example: Week 1 would go A-B-A, week 2 B-A-B, repeat.  This got me a little bit of variety and allowed me to have some extra recovery between sessions of SLDL.  They broke down as such.

**DAY A**

> Axle clean and strict press 3x10/superset with 50 band pull aparts

> Weighted dips 3x12/superset with axle bent over rows 2x15

> Breathing squats 1x20/pull overs 1x20

> Axle Straight Legged Deadlifts 1x15

> Poundstone curls (1 rep more than previous workout each time)

**DAY B**

> Incline DB bench 3x12/superset with 2x15 weighted chins

> Behind the neck press 3x10/superset with 50 band pull aparts

> Breathing squats 1x20/pull overs 1x20

> Kroc rows 1xmax reps

> Axle shrugs against bands 1xmax reps

> Reverse hyper 1x50+ reps

* Once this portion of the workout was finished, I’d drink a protein shake (a PROTEIN shake you philistines: NOT a carb/fat shake.  It was egg whites mixed with a scoop of protein powder), and then finish up with 20 reps of standing ab wheel, 30 glute ham raises, 25 push downs, band curls on day B, and then some manner of 3-5 minutes of conditioning.  

* On top of this, daily, I’d do either 5 minutes of kettlebell armor building complexes w/24kg bells or the “TABEARTA” workout of Barbell bear complexes with 95lbs getting in 3 complexes per round.

* In between Super Squats workouts (to include the two day break on the weekends), I’d do conditioning workouts.  I initially was a little cute and creative, but pretty quickly I settled into a rut of something I referred to as “Armor Bearer”, [which looked like this]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11wjg0LBbQw)


* An “Armor Bearer” is 5 minutes of Dan John’s kettlebell “Armor Building Complex” (2 cleans, 1 press, 3 front squats) followed immediately with TABEARTA (tabata protocol Bear complexes w/95lbs).  

* Just 1 round of these can absolutely nuke you if you really push it (for me, that’s getting around 25 ABCs and a full 8 rounds of 3 complexes with the bears), but for the Tuesday workout I’d typically do 3 rounds of these.  Weekends would be 1-3 rounds.  On Thursdays, I’d end up doing something slightly less aggressive, like a circuit of swings, thrusters and burpee chins or something similar.  Basically, I’d recover/recharge over the weekends, come out hard * * Mon through Wed, and need a slight dip down in intensity on Thurs to be able to absolutely smash Friday.

* On Tues and Thurs, I’d train fasted.  I feel like that’s better for nutrient partitioning post workout.  For the Super Squats workouts, I had half a low carb bagel with sunflower seed butter pre-workout for the first half of the program, switching to a slice of homemade sourdough toast with sunflower butter for the second half…because my wife took up making sourdough and it’s amazing.

* Oh yeah, one other thing: I was STILL training first thing in the morning for all of these workouts.  Typically around 0400.

* What’s worth appreciating is that I realize this violates Super Squats recommendation of resting as much as possible between the workouts, but it SHOULD be noted that this DOES represent a significant reduction in training volume for me.  Instead of 40-60 minute conditioning workouts, I was doing 10-30.  Instead of 10-20 minute conditioning workouts post lifting, it was 3-5.  I was sleeping more, and the volume within the lifting workouts itself was on the lower side.  This program will STILL beat you down, no matter who you are, and it DOES require throttling back to recover.

**NUTRITION**

* It would be WAY too tedious to document what I was eating, because I am a constant grazer as it is and this program just turned my appetite up to 11.  But I’ll say that was probably the biggest thing: I stopped restricting myself and just ate if I felt any hunger.  I still stuck with Deep Water/Mountain Dogg approved stuff for the vast majority of my nutrition, but was a bit more willing to eat “off menu” here and there.  I maintained a focus on food quality, and didn’t need to resort to “dirty” eating to get in my calories.  Between avocados, nuts and nut/sunflower seed butter, it’s pretty easy to jack up calories, and mixed in with a variety of animal based protein sources and some keto magic breads/tortillas, I was in a good way.  My dirtiest daily item was a protein bar/keto bar, which is also one of the first things I cut out of a diet when I’m no longer gaining.

* Biggest meals were always my post training breakfast and my pre-bed time meal.  Eating before bed remains one of the most effective strategies I know for gaining, and I love starting the day off with a win by smashing a VERY large and nutritious breakfast.

**RESULTS**

* As much as it upsets people, I don’t weigh myself, and I took no before/after photos.  

* But what WAS amazing was how I was just smashing lifts every time I trained on this program.  I imagine coming into it with a LOT of accumulated volume and finally taking the time to laser focus it into an abbreviated approach really paid off, especially when paired with a LOT of food.  I’m not an excel ninja, so I’m just going to spell out the progress I had.

* Axle clean and strict press went from 3x10x136 to 2x10x171 and 1x9x171 (so close!). Behind the neck press from 3x10x95 to 3x10x135, Weighted dips went from 3x12x55 to 3x12x100 and weighted chins from 2x15x7.5lbs to 2x15x20lbs(keeping in mind I gained bodyweight through the program), DB bench from 3x12x80s to 3x12x105s, Axle rows went from 2x15x193 to 2x15x228, Axle SLDLs went from 15x243 to 15x283 (doing them AFTER the squats is just awful), Kroc rows from 15x115 to 23x115

* And, of course: Breathing Squats from 20x315 to 30x315…WITH a recovering torn hamstring

**LEESSONS LEARNED**

* The squats themselves are immaterial: it’s more about the loading of the body and hard effort.  In turn, the “5lbs per week” is also immaterial.  Good mornings and increasing reps proved viable, and I’m sure there is much more room to play around with.  But that’s why we run these programs: we learned lessons like that that we can carry forward.

* If you’re not drinking the gallon of milk a day, you’ll have to eat like it’s your job.  I really would have preferred to just suck down a gallon a day and eat normally vs the sheer volume of food I was putting away.  I legit felt like I had been hit by a bomb through weeks 3 and 4, and finally managed to get a handle on things toward the end.

* If we wait until we feel good, we’ll never train.  I tore my hamstring before I was halfway done with the program, and up until the final workout it still ached.  It hurt LESS, sure, but I could still make an argument that I was injured at the final workout. And if I waited until I was “ready” to start again, I have no idea how long that would have taken.  Instead, I “went before I was ready”, squatted through pain, used knee wraps to fake a hamstring, took things slow, etc.  I genuinely do not feel I slowed down my healing rate in doing so: if anything, I sped it up, because I kept the muscle moving and gave it fresh blood.  In addition, I had zero “break back in” period.  Often, people that get injured and rest take FOREVER to get back because, upon their return, they’ll try out the movement that hurt them and still experience some pain in doing so, and they’ll freak out and go back to resting.  My continuing in my training, I effectively did my own rehab, getting the muscle from completely worthless to almost 100% functional, and didn’t miss any training as a result.

**BONUS SUPER SQUATS RAMBLING!**

* NOTE: What is written below are some jumbled thoughts I came up with toward the middle of my Super Squats run, so the timeline of thought processes may seem “off”.

* Going beyond 20 reps has been such a different way to make this program awful, and I feel like it just compliments things so well.  Just by nature of my injury I ended up doing 2 weeks of going up 5lbs a workout before resetting the weight to the start and then going up one REP a workout, and both progression models seem to work out pretty well.  I feel like there’s something to doing this intentional.  Perhaps running the program for 3 weeks where you go up 5lbs per workout, then reset and push max reps.  Another approach would be do 1 week going up 5 reps per workout, then hold that weight for the next week and go up a rep per workout and keep alternating that way.  A way to slow down the weight increases while still making things suck.  You might even do 10lb jumps during the weight increase weeks to compensate for the “down time”.  Another option would be 6 weeks one way, 6 weeks the other, with a program in the middle of course.  

* And then there’s alternate MOVEMENTS to include in there.  I’ve demonstrated that, at least ONE workout of “Super Good Mornings” is viable.  It’d be interesting to see what a full cycle would be like.  I also know that the book talks about hip belt squats, and from there the trap bar is a very logical transition.  And then we can combine that all with the above.  What about a week of good mornings where we progress weights, next week we take that top weight of good mornings and make it a squat week where we’re chasing after max reps, and then next week is a trap bar week?  Are we making conjugate Super Squats?  It’s a bit like Dogg Crapp, which, actually, would ALSO work just dandy here: change between 3 movements every workout.

* I’ve also entertained the idea of being cute and having a theme of “Paul Kelso Super Squats”.  Use the trap bar for presses, rows, trap bar lifts and SLDLs.  I’m literally thinking AS I write this and I realize I just came up with a (potentially) INCREDIBLY effective hypertrophy program with ONE piece of equipment and NO rack.  Just think of how space economic that is.  Biggest issue would be getting the trap bar in place for pressing without a rack, but that circus act CAN happen.  And using radar chest pulls, you don’t need a bench and dumbbell to get the pull over effect.  

* All THIS said, I REALLY don’t think the SSB meets intent here at all.  I feel like a BIG part of the “success” of this program Is having that bar just absolutely CRUSH you for all it’s worth and you just survive for as long as possible.  The SSB is too comfortable AND it allows you to stand there and take the pressure off of you by pushing it back or pulling it forward as needed.  You are ON the clock when it’s a barbell crushing you, and even with the trap bar with straps, you’re still standing there having it pull your shoulders out of the socket.  Don’t ask me about the belt squat: I have no idea how that’s supposed to work.

* I DO have to avoid for falling into the trap of making Super Squats the answer to everything.  I have to appreciate that this laser focused program was effective BECAUSE I came into it with SO much accumulated volume.  In that regard, I plan to do a write-up at some point of Super Squats and Deep Water being yin and yang.  Both absolutely crazy, but SO different in their insanity, making them ideal pairings.  3 days a week of 1x20 vs 1 day a week of 10x10.  Of course, the kind of dude that is just plain ALWAYS running Super Squats and Deep Water back to back is too crazy even for me.  At some point there would need to be some sort of OTHER side of balance, which would probably be a great time for a lighter 5/3/1 program, the 10K swing challenge, or something else just plain wildly different.",Fitness,"Going From 20x315lb Squats to 30x315lb squats In 6 Weeks With a Torn Hamstring: My Review of Super Squats-The ""What Would Bruce Randall Do"" Version-**SUMMARY UP FRONT: THE SQUATS AND THE INJURY**

**INTRO/BACKGROUND**

* I first ran Super Squats when I was in college, well over 15 years ago…and never ran it again since.  In my mind it was one of the most effective programs of all time AND once of the most traumatic experiences of all time.  I could still remember the pain of those 20 rep sets, the anxiety that existed between workouts, and being SO happy when it was over.  I said I’d run it again some day, and had recommended the book to SO many trainees, yet took SO long to finally saddle back up and do it all over again.

* A lot had changed between then and now.  One of the biggest factors being that I had my ACL reconstructed in 2015 after rupturing it and part of my meniscus in a strongman competition.  That changes squats a little.  But I was also much smarter about training and nutrition than I was as a meathead college kid, so that’s cool.

* For the full rundown on stats, I’m 37, 5’9, bodyweight somewhere in the high 180s, have lifted weights for 23 years, competed in strongman for a decade off and on, did some powerlifting, combat sports/martial arts experience, and has accumulated some bumps and scrapes along the way.    

**WHAT SUPER SQUATS IS/IS NOT**

* First, it is NOT a squatting program.  Oh my god I hate how I have to keep explaining this.  Am I the ONLY one who got taught “Don’t judge a book by its cover?”  Same thing with the “30lbs of muscle in 6 weeks” thing: quit focusing on that.  The squatting in Super Squats is PURELY a mechanism employed to trigger muscular bodyweight growth in a trainee.  It wasn’t a program designed with “improving your squat as much as possible!” or “the surefire solution to chicken legs!”: the BREATHING squat is chosen because it’s a way to trigger full body growth.  And no: I don’t mean “it causes the release of HGH/testosterone”: I’m talking about the fact that, when you do breathing squats, you spend a LOT of time with a weight on your back, which is signaling to your body that the whole BODY needs a LOT more muscle SOON if it wants to survive.  The squatting itself adds stimulus, absolutely, but I’ve found that one can employ good mornings to a similar effect, and there’s a solid argument about being able to employ trap bar lifts as well.

* It is a SYSTEM, not a workout.  Specifically, that system is premised upon the idea of putting the entire body under SIGNIFICANT stress 2-3 times a week, and consistently upping that stress so that it’s never able to fully cope.  This is why you use the weight you’d squat for 10 to do 20 reps, and it’s why you add 5lbs per workout.  A lot of folks seem to think the magic is just in the squat set, so they’ll do a set of 20 breathing squats ONE time and go “Yeah, that was hard, but I don’t see the big deal”.  The big deal is that you have to do it AGAIN 2 days later…with 5lbs more than before…for 6 weeks.  You can’t just take the squats part of Super Squats in isolation: it’s a whole system.  It’s also why the gallon of milk a day is associated with it: it’s a system of training insanely hard and then eating VERY big so that you can be recovered enough to achieve the next goal.  It’s why when people ask “what should I do if I fail” on the program, I tell them “don’t”.  If you are actually eating as much as you need to eat and following the program, success should be your only outcome…assuming you have the necessary mental fortitude to get through it.

* [It is a BOOK](https://www.amazon.com/Super-Squats-Pounds-Muscle-Weeks/dp/0926888005).  Every time I see a trainee fail with “Super Squats”, it’s because they’re not actually doing Super Squats, because they didn’t read the book.  The book can be read in an afternoon and it’s $10 on Kindle: there’s zero excuse for not reading it.  It explains EVERYTHING.  It doesn’t just lay out a program: it walks you through step by step how to execute it, gives you instructions on how to perform ALL the exercises, it lays out a very effective nutrition protocol, it gives you psychological coaching to get through the squat set (along with saying MANY times that it’s 3 deep breaths between EVERY rep…but I digress), and even goes into the history of squatting and strong people in general, and EVEN gives you a follow-on plan so you can actually run Super Squats for QUITE a long duration.  There is a reason I practically THROW this book at every new trainee: if you read it, you will have pretty much everything you could ever need.

**MY RUN OF THE PROGRAM**

* When I began Super Squats, I was amazed at how many people who read my blog kept asking me what my plan was.  “You started at 315lbs: are you planning on going all the way to 405 for 20?”  “You’ve done 5x10x405: are you planning on going higher than 405?”  “Are you planning on making this even more challenging than the book says?”.  I kept saying the same thing: “My goal is to experience this experience”.  It was to the point that I think OTHER people were getting anxiety over my “lack of a plan”.

* Folks: CHAOS IS THE PLAN.  It’s not just a thing I say: it’s the truth.

* …and BOY was it the truth.  When I originally mapped out the 6 week block of Super Squats, I had a full 6 weeks on my schedule with uninterrupted time set out.  2 weeks before I started, my job threw a trip on my schedule from Mon through Thurs of my first week of the program.   Cool, time to call an audible.  I did the first workout on a Friday, my second workout the Monday I left for the trip, and the third workout on the Friday that I returned home.

* …except that, in between Monday and Friday, on that work trip, I came down with RSV.  On Tuesday night of that week, I did not sleep, because my fever was so high I had forgotten how to sleep.  I literally ate non-stop for 2 hours before that, because my kid had RSV before I left and they were taking FOREVER to heal because they wouldn’t eat, so I knew calories were the answer.  My appetite was shot, but that’s never slowed me down before, and, thankfully, my room was fully stocked with travel food, because I know how to travel.

* …and then I STILL did my 3rd workout on Friday, with RSV…and promptly proceeded to pull something in my innerquad/outer hamstring on my right leg on rep 15, because I forgot to factor in the significant impact of dehydration when you’ve been losing all your fluids to an awful ragged cough.  Which, if you want some real fun: try BREATHING squats with RSV.  Also: symptoms last for 2 weeks…so that’s cool.

* Whelp, Chaos it the Plan: “What Would Bruce Randall Do?”  He’d do some goddamn good mornings, and that was EXACTLY what I did.  I figured: if a dude that broke his leg in 7 places could use good mornings to build up to a 600lb squat, I could use them to get through Super Squats.  [Cue one of the hardest workouts of my life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp0RHBNFwgo)


* I kept the weight EXACTLY the same as what I failed on with the squats, because I figured THAT was the most significant part of the program.  It’s why I picked good mornings as well: it’d keep the weight ON my back in the same spot as before with the same weight as before.  

* I genuinely think that workout was so hard it scared my body into healing, because I was able to return to squatting again for the next workout.  I was in pain, sure, and I had to take the squats slow, but I wasn’t missing any reps.

* And then, like an idiot, I forgot the lessons I had learned about hydration and keeping my legs warm and, without my morning Gatorade and sweats, went and TORE my hamstring…this time on rep 20!  Yup: that was workout 7.

* Back on the good mornings, but this time the hamstring was so borked I couldn’t get the weight that I needed to for progression.  I got hurt with 345, and 350 wasn’t stable, so I warmed up until I felt the hamstring start to buckle and went for [max rep GMs]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tcuISpN63w)


* So now Chaos really IS the plan: 5lb progressions between workouts just ceased.  What is one to do?  Well, the middle of that good morning workout and my next squat workout, Thanksgiving happened, which meant I had to [pull 401 reps with 135lbs on a high handle trap bar in a single set]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWkSz-QEtSk)


* Because traditions damnit!

* Next Super Squats workout, all my hamstring would tolerate was 315lbs, so I went and took it for a ride and only managed 16 reps before I could feel it start to buckle and bulge.  So I got to yes by racking the bar, trying 1 more rep, hitting my pullovers, and then immediately getting pissed off, strip the bar to 245lbs and get my 20 reps in.  Mission absolutely accomplished. Please note my use of knee wraps to hold my hamstring in place/together, as that would be in effect for the remainder of the program.

* …and with THAT, the new way forward began.  We had finished workout 9, which was halfway through the program, and a new plan emerged: take 315 for as many reps as possible.  Which is TOTALLY in-line with something the book discussed about dudes going for 30 reps with breathing squats. Chaos is the plan, and we moved forward with that plan.

* …and comically enough, people STILL asked me what I was planning.  “Are you going to stick with 315 or eventually up the weight?”  This whole run of SS could NOT be any more an indication of “Chaos is the Plan”.  And I’M SO thankful that I embraced that from the start.  If I set out with a goal to squat 405 for 20, I’d just be miserable with how this whole experience turned out, and probably would have shut it all down at the halfway point when I “failed” to add 5lbs.  Instead, I got to experience the most challenging run of Super Squats perhaps EVER performed: afflicted with RSV for about half of it, through torn muscles, adding a rep each session and nearly blacking out from effort, with some Bruce Randall good mornings for good measure.  This is the Chaos edition of Super Squats, and it’s amazing.

* For those that want to watch the whole process, [here is the youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xRsOupFXRk&list=PLfcuGAffLlSdHGXZa4ER6fRyj-7FrJPuy)

**MY SPECIFIC TRAINING PLAN**

* The very first time I ran the program 15 years ago, I did an abbreviated approach, because that was all the rage then.  This time, I wanted to stay pretty close to what the book laid out.  I did no calf work, and my ab work was standing ab wheel, but for the most part I stuck with the program laid out in the book while employing the exercises listed.  

* I created two separate training days (A and B) and rotated between them every training day, 3x a week.  Do, for example: Week 1 would go A-B-A, week 2 B-A-B, repeat.  This got me a little bit of variety and allowed me to have some extra recovery between sessions of SLDL.  They broke down as such.

**DAY A**

> Axle clean and strict press 3x10/superset with 50 band pull aparts

> Weighted dips 3x12/superset with axle bent over rows 2x15

> Breathing squats 1x20/pull overs 1x20

> Axle Straight Legged Deadlifts 1x15

> Poundstone curls (1 rep more than previous workout each time)

**DAY B**

> Incline DB bench 3x12/superset with 2x15 weighted chins

> Behind the neck press 3x10/superset with 50 band pull aparts

> Breathing squats 1x20/pull overs 1x20

> Kroc rows 1xmax reps

> Axle shrugs against bands 1xmax reps

> Reverse hyper 1x50+ reps

* Once this portion of the workout was finished, I’d drink a protein shake (a PROTEIN shake you philistines: NOT a carb/fat shake.  It was egg whites mixed with a scoop of protein powder), and then finish up with 20 reps of standing ab wheel, 30 glute ham raises, 25 push downs, band curls on day B, and then some manner of 3-5 minutes of conditioning.  

* On top of this, daily, I’d do either 5 minutes of kettlebell armor building complexes w/24kg bells or the “TABEARTA” workout of Barbell bear complexes with 95lbs getting in 3 complexes per round.

* In between Super Squats workouts (to include the two day break on the weekends), I’d do conditioning workouts.  I initially was a little cute and creative, but pretty quickly I settled into a rut of something I referred to as “Armor Bearer”, [which looked like this]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11wjg0LBbQw)

Weekends would be 1-3 rounds.  On Thursdays, I’d end up doing something slightly less aggressive, like a circuit of swings, thrusters and burpee chins or something similar.  Basically, I’d recover/recharge over the weekends, come out hard * * Mon through Wed, and need a slight dip down in intensity on Thurs to be able to absolutely smash Friday.

* On Tues and Thurs, I’d train fasted.  I feel like that’s better for nutrient partitioning post workout.  For the Super Squats workouts, I had half a low carb bagel with sunflower seed butter pre-workout for the first half of the program, switching to a slice of homemade sourdough toast with sunflower butter for the second half…because my wife took up making sourdough and it’s amazing.

* Oh yeah, one other thing: I was STILL training first thing in the morning for all of these workouts.  Typically around 0400.

* What’s worth appreciating is that I realize this violates Super Squats recommendation of resting as much as possible between the workouts, but it SHOULD be noted that this DOES represent a significant reduction in training volume for me.

**BONUS SUPER SQUATS RAMBLING!**

* NOTE: What is written below are some jumbled thoughts I came up with toward the middle of my Super Squats run, so the timeline of thought processes may seem “off”.

* Going beyond 20 reps has been such a different way to make this program awful, and I feel like it just compliments things so well.

I feel like there’s something to doing this intentional.  Perhaps running the program for 3 weeks where you go up 5lbs per workout, then reset and push max reps.  Another approach would be do 1 week going up 5 reps per workout, then hold that weight for the next week and go up a rep per workout and keep alternating that way.  A way to slow down the weight increases while still making things suck.  You might even do 10lb jumps during the weight increase weeks to compensate for the “down time”.  Another option would be 6 weeks one way, 6 weeks the other, with a program in the middle of course.  

* And then there’s alternate MOVEMENTS to include in there.  I’ve demonstrated that, at least ONE workout of “Super Good Mornings” is viable.  It’d be interesting to see what a full cycle would be like.  I also know that the book talks about hip belt squats, and from there the trap bar is a very logical transition.  And then we can combine that all with the above.  What about a week of good mornings where we progress weights, next week we take that top weight of good mornings and make it a squat week where we’re chasing after max reps, and then next week is a trap bar week?  Are we making conjugate Super Squats?  It’s a bit like Dogg Crapp, which, actually, would ALSO work just dandy here: change between 3 movements every workout.

* I’ve also entertained the idea of being cute and having a theme of “Paul Kelso Super Squats”.  Use the trap bar for presses, rows, trap bar lifts and SLDLs.  I’m literally thinking AS I write this and I realize I just came up with a (potentially) INCREDIBLY effective hypertrophy program with ONE piece of equipment and NO rack.  Just think of how space economic that is.  Biggest issue would be getting the trap bar in place for pressing without a rack, but that circus act CAN happen.  And using radar chest pulls, you don’t need a bench and dumbbell to get the pull over effect.  

* All THIS said, I REALLY don’t think the SSB meets intent here at all.  I feel like a BIG part of the “success” of this program Is having that bar just absolutely CRUSH you for all it’s worth and you just survive for as long as possible.  The SSB is too comfortable AND it allows you to stand there and take the pressure off of you by pushing it back or pulling it forward as needed.  You are ON the clock when it’s a barbell crushing you, and even with the trap bar with straps, you’re still standing there having it pull your shoulders out of the socket.  Don’t ask me about the belt squat: I have no idea how that’s supposed to work.

* I DO have to avoid for falling into the trap of making Super Squats the answer to everything.  I have to appreciate that this laser focused program was effective BECAUSE I came into it with SO much accumulated volume.  In that regard, I plan to do a write-up at some point of Super Squats and Deep Water being yin and yang.  Both absolutely crazy, but SO different in their insanity, making them ideal pairings.  3 days a week of 1x20 vs 1 day a week of 10x10.  Of course, the kind of dude that is just plain ALWAYS running Super Squats and Deep Water back to back is too crazy even for me.  At some point there would need to be some sort of OTHER side of balance, which would probably be a great time for a lighter 5/3/1 program, the 10K swing challenge, or something else just plain wildly different."

Bit nervous but my hope is that my results, and the things I did both right and wrong, can provide a more ""average dude"" sort of view. I'm not jacked, I'm not swole, I can't bench 5 plates, but I feel I've made decent progress despite some wasted time along the way. I'm always up for discussion on fitness, I've learned a lot but always have more to learn.

&nbsp;

[Current - 195~200](https://i.imgur.com/PlKXC7u.jpg)

&nbsp;

**My 20s and 30s**

A call-center job chained to a desk, along with moving to a big city and eating amazing food, caused me to balloon from my teenage size to 300 lbs in my 20s. At my worst, I was eating ~4000 calories of trash a day, with no real veggies and very little protein. A typical breakfast was a stop at 7-11 for an extra-large iced mocha latte, two donuts and three deep fried taquitos. I would snack all day on Doritos and Dr Pepper. A typical supper was a 1200cal chicken parm sub. I had severe sleep apnea, various bowel issues, fucked up knees, constant back pain, rashes, irritated eyes and nose. I was a walking heart attack.

&nbsp;

**Initial Weight Loss**

This is where the ""mistakes were made"" meme comes in, at least according to current wisdom. In 2015 at age 35 I went to the doctor, who determined that a) my blood pressure was moments away from a stroke and b) in her heavy French accent, ""we found some diabetes"" in my blood work. I asked her what to do, and thankfully she did not give me pills, but said ""lose weight."" I said I would.  Had a little cry in the car, and decided then and there to change.

It gets dicey here, because I googled the whole diabetes thing, and it sure seemed like sugar and simple carbs were to blame. Rather than take a reasonable approach, I dove head-long into Paleo, religious fervor and all. The good news? Cutting out carbs had immediate effect, and ""felt easy"", in that meals were still enjoyable. By pure willpower and my new belief that ""all sugar was poison,"" I quit everything else cold turkey. Drank water only, no more snacks, no more pop, nothing. I tracked everything with MyFitnessPal, which I still preach to this day (even if temporarily, to see where you're at). My daily caloric intake went down into the 1300-1500 calorie range. And I was very, very consistent.

The weight melted off. As I'm sure many would agree, too fast. 30 lbs in 2 weeks. 50-60 in about 3 months. From April to November I went from 300 lbs to 190. My only physical activity was walking. EVERY SINGLE DAY, no matter what, at least one hour, often two. Podcasts probably saved my life. Eventually, I worked my way up to jogging and then to running. Zero lifting. Most joint pain went away, bowels started working right, rashes and itchiness and disappeared. I ""cured"" the pre-diabetes, got my BP under control. After maintaining my weight for four years, I retired my CPAP machine. Went from a 44 waist to 32, 2XL shirts to Medium.

So this may all sound amazing, but the low-carb stuff and severe calorie restriction damaged my relationship with food and I still struggle a bit today (I'm happy to discuss this further in the comments). Also, because I didn't lift, I lost a ton of muscle, and looked kinda gaunt and flabby (see: pic of me in the red t-shirt.) I badly pulled my quad helping a friend move a couch, and realized I might've made some mistakes.

&nbsp;

**Starting Lifting**

Strength training began in late 2016 after talking with some friends about it. At first I just bought a shitty weight set for home and randomly did exercises, poorly. Eventually I got to talking with my friend Brandon, who's also an online S&C coach, and we started on a very beginner-friendly Functional Fitness program. I know that term has been beaten to death in online fitness over the years but considering my numerous mobility and joint issues, it was the right call. Simple bodyweight exercises to improve mobility (hip hinge drills, squat holds, T-spine mobility), lots of isometric work to build core strength (planks, dead bugs), and most importantly, work to strengthen my back using Stuart McGill's ""Big 3.""

&nbsp;

**Trail Running**

While beginning this, I still felt that I ""needed"" to run. My knees felt good. I moved up North and out to the country, and got further into trail running. This culminated in competing in my first race, a 7km trail run at Limberlost Forest. This is where my coach helped me understand that you don't need to run miles a day to have ""decent"" conditioning; he insisted I not go out and ""run 7km every day."" Instead, we did sprint drills on my rest days, 10sec on, 20sec off, as well as hill sprints. To my surprise, I felt good during the race and finished 77th out of 200+ entries.

It also made me realize that I don't really like running, and I just wanted to prove to myself that I could do it. So I haven't really gotten back into it since. The iron suits me better.

&nbsp;

**Current Training**

Because I started in my late 30s after 15yrs of destroying my body, there's a heavy focus on warm up and mobility work. Some on this sub might see it as busy work or junk volume, but it's all in the service of staying pain-free OR working around minor aches and pains, and improving on my limitations. I care about that more than I care about numbers on the bar. I don't back squat, for example--I either front squat or KB squat. There's a lot of Dan John and Mike Boyle influence.

The other day when I was sitting in a deep, long squat at work, a co-worker was asking me wtf I was doing. I said ""I'm squatting like this at 42 so I can squat like this at 82.""

Since I began weight training, I have missed zero training days. ZERO. In many cases I've delayed one by a day, and I've worked through and around minor injuries and sickness. When I travel I bring a kettlebell and I get work done. I've also lifted with COVID--perks of a home gym. No matter what, above all else, CONSISTENCY. Good workout, shit workout, just TRAIN. 80% effort the rest of your life is better than 100% effort half the time.

My current program consists of four 4-week blocks. First block is high rep work, second block is ramping reps, third block increases RPE, ramping upward each week, and fourth block ramps heavy maxes, no more than 5 reps on most lifts. Full-body 3x a week. I feel this suits me because I have no specific goals, and I don't compete. I have no idea what my 1RMs are and don't really care. I just want to progress. The programming is vaguely powerlifting-based, in that each day focuses on Bench, Deadlift, or Squat, but my coach is a kettlebell fiend, and I've fallen in love with them as well, so they factor in as often as the barbell.

I don't want to make the post even bigger than it already is, so I don't think I should post the entire program. But here's an example of this week, which is ramping RPE and includes complimentary plyo movements in a Giant Set:

&nbsp;

**Warmups**

* [MBSC Flow Warmup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Brjs42oQ7FU&t=2s)
* Box Jumps, Side Planks, Hardstyle Planks, Cable Lifts and Cable Chops

&nbsp;

**Monday**

* 2KB Rack Squat 3x8 +Box Jump x5
* Pause Pushups 3x8 +Chest Pass x5
* 1 Leg Hip Lift Isometric

&nbsp;

* 2KB Single Leg Deadlift 3x8
* Chin-Ups 3x8 +Ball Slam x5
* Standing 1-arm KB Press 3x6

&nbsp;

* 2KB Swing 5x15 to finish

&nbsp;

**Wednesday**

* Trap Bar Deadlift 3x10,5,5 +KB Swing x8
* Olympic Ring Row 3x8
* Pushup Walkout+Pushups (3x5,6,7,8 reps by week)

&nbsp;

* Skater Squat to 2 pads 3x5 (AMRAP last week)
* Incline DB Bench 3x8 +Chest Pass x5
* Pallof Press (3x8,10,12,15 by week)

&nbsp;

* KB Clean and Press 2x8 to finish

&nbsp;

**Friday**

* 2KB Bulgarian Split Squat 3x8
* Bench Press 3x8 +Chest Pass x5
* Ab Fallout (2x8,8,10,12 by week)

&nbsp;

* Goblet Lateral Lunge 3x8 +Goblet Squat x8
* Meadows Row 3x8 +Ball Slam x5
* Deficit Calf Raises (2x5,6,7,8 by week)

&nbsp;

* Poundstone Curls to failure x2
* Tricep Pullovers x2 to failure to Finish

&nbsp;

Note: my ""Finish"" varies wildly depending on what I want to do, and also weather. I often like to do heavy farmer's carries (bodyweight or more) to failure or sled pushes in the summer. In the winter I stick mostly to kettlebell complexes and just try and wear myself out.

Rest days are for active rest. I walk my dog daily, I do a ton of hiking and kayaking, and I'm thinking about buying a bike. I also work in auto parts so I spend most of my day on my feet, walking around a warehouse carrying things.

If I had to bro-guess my lifts (based on 5 rep maxes), they're around 385 on the deadlift, 190-200 bench, and 200 on the front squat.

&nbsp;

**Nutrition**

As mentioned before, my diet lost a ton of weight, but really messed with my eating habits.  After I hit my goal, I simply reintroduced more calories, but after lots of reading and getting to know the science better, I dropped the Paleo and started eating carbs again. But I STILL ""feared carbs,"" and tended to not eat as much as I should. I was sort of permanently hovering around 2000 calories until last year, worried about putting weight back on, worried about the bathroom scale, worried about carbs. I was always cold. I felt great in terms of strength and energy though.

My coach finally convinced me to just not look at the scale, and try to eat a bit more intuitively. The result? I gained like 1 lb over the course of a year, while recomping muscle a bit and looking better. Lifts went up. After that, we talked about adding more calories, mostly carbs. From my lowest weight of 183 (first shirtless pic), I've put on about 15 pounds, some of which I sure hope is muscle (last pic). If and when my pants get tight, I'll probably cut again. After all, I've done it before.

I really do consider my nutrition a strength now. I try not to track anymore, hovering around 2600-2800 calories. I shoot for 0.7-0.8g/lb of protein, which means 170-180g. I fill the rest in with carbs and fat, moreso carbs now, which is where I was lacking before. Breakfast every day is a protein shake with a scoop of whey isolate, spinach, fruit of some kind, creatine, and unsweetened almond milk, and a bowl of oatmeal. I meal prep lunches EVERY. SINGLE. SUNDAY no matter what. Lunch is 40-50g of protein, usually chicken or ground turkey, roasted potatoes or rice, and a veg like Broccoli. Small protein bar for a snack every single day, a cup of plain Greek yogurt most days, sometimes with chocolate chips or berries in it. Suppers are where I let loose and play around, I love to cook, but at their core is always 40-50g of protein. I try to keep red meat to once a week, usually a lean cut of steak. Post-workout dinners are often big breakfast plates with 3-4 eggs, egg whites, turkey bacon, roasted potatoes and a good multi-grain bread with peanut butter. To ""get my carbs in"" now, I'll have another bowl of oatmeal or a PB&J sandwich.

I drink only black coffee and water. I eat three big meals and two or three snacks every day. But I've also learned to live a little, my healthy habits are firmly in place so it's okay to eat junk now and then. A latte every now and then, a restaurant a couple times a month (usually a big breakfast). Occasionally a Halo Top ice cream. If I want a cookie or a donut, I have one. I still try to keep cheap snacks out of the house to prevent binging--if I want a treat, I have to go to the bakery and get a treat. Make it worth it.

I would say these are the four biggest tips I could give on nutrition: track what you eat (at LEAST for the first few months), have the occasional snack, don't drink your calories, and MEAL PREP. You ""can"" do a huge caloric deficit like I did and succeed, and then go back to eating somewhat normally, but most will fail in that.  Better to consistently reinforce good habits and drop the weight more slowly. For others, simply focusing on becoming stronger and more mobile while eating ""a bit better"" can be enough. More protein, more fibre, less junk.

&nbsp;

**Mental Health, Body Image**

This is still a daily struggle for me, even though I do feel some pride in what I accomplished. I struggle with anxiety, and looking back it was obvious I stress-ate. I've replaced the food with behavioural therapy, and trying to just relax more, get out in nature, get off social media, read more books.

I have loose skin, but as you can see in the pics it's not too bad now that I've put some muscle on. If I bend over, it still looks like melted cheese, but if I'm standing up, I have abs and my obliques even show up a little. I think since I started eating enough, my shoulders, chest and even traps have come in a little. My quads have grown very noticeably, and my wife says ""I have an ass now."" But body dysmorphia is real and I still think ""I'm getting too fat"" or ""my arms aren't big enough."" I just keep telling myself that consistency is all that matters. Show up and do the damn thing. I owe a lot to my coach, keeping me grounded and keeping my workouts interesting and challenging. I look forward to training.  I do this for overall fitness, health and well-being. I do this so I can still be moving and active and healthy in my 80s. I'm mostly pain free and I now have the knowledge to stay that way. I look, move and feel better at 42 than I did at 22.  It also encouraged my wife to eat better and exercise, and she's lost about 40 lbs from her heaviest! I couldn't be more proud of her.

I'm happy to answer further questions in the comments. Thanks for listening to my rambling!",Fitness,"Progress: 42/M/5'11 300lbs to 183lbs-Hi all. u/boeingman737 's progress post finally gave me the courage to share my progress.

The programming is vaguely powerlifting-based, in that each day focuses on Bench, Deadlift, or Squat, but my coach is a kettlebell fiend, and I've fallen in love with them as well, so they factor in as often as the barbell.

I don't want to make the post even bigger than it already is, so I don't think I should post the entire program. But here's an example of this week, which is ramping RPE and includes complimentary plyo movements in a Giant Set:

&nbsp;

**Warmups**

* [MBSC Flow Warmup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Brjs42oQ7FU&t=2s)
* Box Jumps, Side Planks, Hardstyle Planks, Cable Lifts and Cable Chops

&nbsp;

**Monday**

* 2KB Rack Squat 3x8 +Box Jump x5
* Pause Pushups 3x8 +Chest Pass x5
* 1 Leg Hip Lift Isometric

&nbsp;

* 2KB Single Leg Deadlift 3x8
* Chin-Ups 3x8 +Ball Slam x5
* Standing 1-arm KB Press 3x6

&nbsp;

* 2KB Swing 5x15 to finish

&nbsp;

**Wednesday**

* Trap Bar Deadlift 3x10,5,5 +KB Swing x8
* Olympic Ring Row 3x8
* Pushup Walkout+Pushups (3x5,6,7,8 reps by week)

&nbsp;

* Skater Squat to 2 pads 3x5 (AMRAP last week)
* Incline DB Bench 3x8 +Chest Pass x5
* Pallof Press (3x8,10,12,15 by week)

&nbsp;

* KB Clean and Press 2x8 to finish

&nbsp;

**Friday**

* 2KB Bulgarian Split Squat 3x8
* Bench Press 3x8 +Chest Pass x5
* Ab Fallout (2x8,8,10,12 by week)

&nbsp;

* Goblet Lateral Lunge 3x8 +Goblet Squat x8
* Meadows Row 3x8 +Ball Slam x5
* Deficit Calf Raises (2x5,6,7,8 by week)

&nbsp;

* Poundstone Curls to failure x2
* Tricep Pullovers x2 to failure to Finish

&nbsp;

Note: my ""Finish"" varies wildly depending on what I want to do, and also weather. I often like to do heavy farmer's carries (bodyweight or more) to failure or sled pushes in the summer. In the winter I stick mostly to kettlebell complexes and just try and wear myself out.

Rest days are for active rest. I walk my dog daily, I do a ton of hiking and kayaking, and I'm thinking about buying a bike. I also work in auto parts so I spend most of my day on my feet, walking around a warehouse carrying things.

If I had to bro-guess my lifts (based on 5 rep maxes), they're around 385 on the deadlift, 190-200 bench, and 200 on the front squat.

&nbsp;

**Nutrition**

As mentioned before, my diet lost a ton of weight, but really messed with my eating habits.  After I hit my goal, I simply reintroduced more calories, but after lots of reading and getting to know the science better, I dropped the Paleo and started eating carbs again. But I STILL ""feared carbs,"" and tended to not eat as much as I should. I was sort of permanently hovering around 2000 calories until last year, worried about putting weight back on, worried about the bathroom scale, worried about carbs. I was always cold. I felt great in terms of strength and energy though.

My coach finally convinced me to just not look at the scale, and try to eat a bit more intuitively. The result? I gained like 1 lb over the course of a year, while recomping muscle a bit and looking better. Lifts went up. After that, we talked about adding more calories, mostly carbs. From my lowest weight of 183 (first shirtless pic), I've put on about 15 pounds, some of which I sure hope is muscle (last pic). If and when my pants get tight, I'll probably cut again. After all, I've done it before.

I really do consider my nutrition a strength now. I try not to track anymore, hovering around 2600-2800 calories. I shoot for 0.7-0.8g/lb of protein, which means 170-180g. I fill the rest in with carbs and fat, moreso carbs now, which is where I was lacking before. Breakfast every day is a protein shake with a scoop of whey isolate, spinach, fruit of some kind, creatine, and unsweetened almond milk, and a bowl of oatmeal. I meal prep lunches EVERY. SINGLE. SUNDAY no matter what. Lunch is 40-50g of protein, usually chicken or ground turkey, roasted potatoes or rice, and a veg like Broccoli. Small protein bar for a snack every single day, a cup of plain Greek yogurt most days, sometimes with chocolate chips or berries in it. Suppers are where I let loose and play around, I love to cook, but at their core is always 40-50g of protein. I try to keep red meat to once a week, usually a lean cut of steak. Post-workout dinners are often big breakfast plates with 3-4 eggs, egg whites, turkey bacon, roasted potatoes and a good multi-grain bread with peanut butter. To ""get my carbs in"" now, I'll have another bowl of oatmeal or a PB&J sandwich.

I drink only black coffee and water. I eat three big meals and two or three snacks every day. But I've also learned to live a little, my healthy habits are firmly in place so it's okay to eat junk now and then. A latte every now and then, a restaurant a couple times a month (usually a big breakfast). Occasionally a Halo Top ice cream. If I want a cookie or a donut, I have one. I still try to keep cheap snacks out of the house to prevent binging--if I want a treat, I have to go to the bakery and get a treat. Make it worth it.

I would say these are the four biggest tips I could give on nutrition: track what you eat (at LEAST for the first few months), have the occasional snack, don't drink your calories, and MEAL PREP. You ""can"" do a huge caloric deficit like I did and succeed, and then go back to eating somewhat normally, but most will fail in that.  Better to consistently reinforce good habits and drop the weight more slowly. For others, simply focusing on becoming stronger and more mobile while eating ""a bit better"" can be enough. More protein, more fibre, less junk.

&nbsp;

**Mental Health, Body Image**

This is still a daily struggle for me, even though I do feel some pride in what I accomplished. I struggle with anxiety, and looking back it was obvious I stress-ate. I've replaced the food with behavioural therapy, and trying to just relax more, get out in nature, get off social media, read more books.

I have loose skin, but as you can see in the pics it's not too bad now that I've put some muscle on. If I bend over, it still looks like melted cheese, but if I'm standing up, I have abs and my obliques even show up a little. I think since I started eating enough, my shoulders, chest and even traps have come in a little. My quads have grown very noticeably, and my wife says ""I have an ass now."" But body dysmorphia is real and I still think ""I'm getting too fat"" or ""my arms aren't big enough."" I just keep telling myself that consistency is all that matters. Show up and do the damn thing. I owe a lot to my coach, keeping me grounded and keeping my workouts interesting and challenging. I look forward to training.  I do this for overall fitness, health and well-being. I do this so I can still be moving and active and healthy in my 80s. I'm mostly pain free and I now have the knowledge to stay that way. I look, move and feel better at 42 than I did at 22.  It also encouraged my wife to eat better and exercise, and she's lost about 40 lbs from her heaviest! I couldn't be more proud of her.

I'm happy to answer further questions in the comments. Thanks for listening to my rambling!"

2022-12-11 15:53:03,Review Of Fitness Studies VIII: Stretching For Muscle Growth? Pain? Beta-Alanine?,"Hello! There was a time awhile ago where I had posted some summaries of journal articles on general fitness. The idea was to help condense important information and make it accessible to the layperson who simply wants to get healthy. I have had some free time recently and I figured I would share some cool papers I read. With this text, I hope that everyone can learn something and that a fruitful and interesting discussion can occur below. I will try my best to answer any queries people may have. Feel free to leave any criticism as well since writing educational content is a skill I am continuously trying to hone. I am not advertising any sort of product or premium access to whatever but if you would like to offer support beyond a comment in this thread, feel free to PM me. Enjoy!

---------------------------------------------------

Schoenfeld et al. (2022) wrote a review on the potential for stretching in between sets to be a time-efficient way to gain muscle. The theoretical basis for this novel practice consists of a few ideas. Firstly, our muscles contain many sensors that detect tension, both active and passive. We know that the active sensors are directly linked to pathways that are essential to muscle gain. We do not have much practical evidence that the passive sensors have the same links but it is possible. Other theories include flattening of the muscle cell nuclei (the control centre of the cell) and opening of specific channels in the muscle whenever we stretch. Again, this is all highly theoretical and we have yet to see any findings that explicitly demonstrate that these processes lead to muscle gain.

Upon the foundation of promising animal studies, there have been a few studies looking at humans using stretching during rest periods between sets to try to elicit more muscle gains. Unfortunately, the results are fairly equivocal when looking at the entirety of the data and most of the studies were all conducted a little differently. Van Every et al. (2022) carried out an experiment in which 21 young, untrained males performed a straight leg calf-raise on a leg press machine and a seated calf-raise for 4 sets each, twice a week for 8 weeks. If you would like to understand why they did these two exercises specifically, refer to the side-note below.

The catch in the study was that one calf would rest for 2 minutes between sets as one would usually do while the other calf would stretch for 30 seconds during the 2 minute rest period. The stretch would use the full load of their set. For example, if the participant was calf-raising 50 kilograms on the leg press, after the final repetition, they would keep the 50 kilograms on and immediately descend into a stretched position and hold it for 30 seconds. Unfortunately, the authors did not specify how “hard” the subjects should stretch. All the participants were familiarized with the exercises for a week prior to the exercise programme and they also did 10 repetition maximum testing to prescribe adequate loads. All sets were done to failure in the 8-12 repetition range. To observe muscle changes, the researchers used ultrasound scans and they also used a dynamometer to detect muscle strength adaptations. The ultrasound measures were conducted 48 hours away from exercise to prevent muscle swelling from influencing the observations.

The authors found that the soleus grew more in the calves that had been stretched during the inter-set rest periods. However, the range of differences between groups in soleus growth spans from absolutely no difference at all to a large difference. It should also be highlighted that we expect a range of error in measurement and the finding falls within this range so it is possible this difference was not real and can be attributed to lack of precision in ultrasound technique or interpretation. The strength changes were similar in that the stretch group had greater strength improvements but the variation in results was high. Other calf muscles did not demonstrate any significant differences between groups. If we assume the greater soleus growth to be true, it may be related to the soleus’ muscle architecture. It is composed of mainly type 1 fibers (low force production but high fatigue resistance) with shorter muscle fibers that are usually rather resistant to growth. While the results are not incredible, this low-risk method of training may help with the stubborn calf muscle gains and muscle growth in general.

Coming back to the review by Schoenfeld et al. (2022), they recommend that if you would like to implement stretches between sets, it should be done immediately after set completion. This is due to a phenomenon known as “residual force enhancement”. When we stretch a muscle under load as opposed to passively, it actually produces more tension. For example, instead of hopping off the calf-raise machine to do a stretch, it may be better to stay on the machine while putting yourself in the bottom, stretched position under the exercise workload. The authors advise to hold the stretch at at least an 8 on the rate of perceived exertion scale. It is also likely that stretching using the load you lift during the working sets is beneficial.

**TL;DR:** Stretching between sets is a novel idea that may be a time-efficient way to increase muscle growth. However, much more research is needed.

**Side-Note:**
The seated calf-raise allows for better targeting of the soleus muscle, the muscle deeper in the calf. To understand why this happens, we must grasp some mechanical concepts of the muscle. A muscle is able to produce the most force at certain lengths. If the muscle is too taut or too slack, it is unable to create as much force. In the science world, this is referred to as the muscle length-tension relationship.

Basically, this is because for force production to occur, proteins in our muscles need to form bridges. When the muscle is too taut or too slack, the bridges are not able to be properly built resulting in low force production. Keeping that in mind, let us take a look at the gastrocnemius, which is the calf muscle that lies on top of your soleus muscle. The gastrocnemius originates from a bone in your thigh, above and behind your knee. It travels down the back of your leg and attaches behind your heel. 

You can pretend that this muscle is a string that is attached between these two points. Now imagine pulling on this string and two things should happen. One, your ankle will bend which causes your toes to be pointed forward like a ballerina. Second, your knee will bend. So what is special about the gastrocnemius is that it is able to perform movements at both the knee and the ankle. However, if for example, the gastrocnemius is helping the knee bend to a great degree, like in a seated calf raise, that means that the gastrocnemius is shortening a lot. If you remember what was mentioned earlier, this means that the gastrocnemius is now at a length where it cannot produce a lot of force because of how shortened it has become. So if I were to now ask the gastrocnemius to do an ankle movement, like a seated calf raise, it would be difficult as it cannot produce much force at an already shortened length. How are we able to do a seated calf raise then? Luckily, the soleus does not attach above the knee so its length is unaffected when we bend or straighten our knee. Thus, the soleus is the main provider of force to complete the seated calf raise. This phenomenon that the gastrocnemius muscle encounters (and many others muscles as well!) is called “active insufficiency”. We are able to use active insufficiency to our advantage in many cases but perhaps we can cover that another time.

The next paper we are covering is by Harvie et al. (2015) in which they explore how visual feedback affects the pain experience. Regardless if you are active or sedentary, you are bound to encounter injuries in your life. Naturally, pain is associated with these injuries and the pain sensation comes in a variety of forms. Everyone will have their own unique stories with pain and this paper will serve as an excellent tool to understanding more about how pain works and what factors affect the feeling of pain.

The researchers recruited 24 people with chronic neck pain and had them perform neck rotations while wearing a virtual reality headset. The participants would be seated in a chair with a belt strapped around their body at the shoulders to isolate the neck rotation. The virtual reality headset allowed the experimenters to adjust the rotation speed of the virtual environment. For example, if they were to slow down the virtual rotation speed and you turned your head 45 degrees, it may only look like you have turned your head 35 degrees because the rotation in the virtual world is so slow. The researchers created three different conditions that each subject went through. The first was under normal settings where the virtual reality rotation and real-life rotation were matched 1 to 1. The other conditions involved either the virtual rotation being slower or faster than real-life rotation by 20%. 20% was chosen because in a previous study, people could tell that virtual rotation speeds had been adjusted if they went beyond 20% in either direction. Each subject would do 6 rotations to both sides under each condition and indicate their pain level on a 0-10 scale. Computer programs would measure how far people were able to rotate their necks before the onset of pain. The virtual environment was also different for every condition to prevent people from using visual cues as an anchor for maintaining the same rotation every time.

It was found that when the virtual rotation speed was slower than real life, people were able to rotate their necks further by about 6% before the onset of pain. When the virtual rotation speed was faster, the pain-free range of motion of neck rotation was 7% less on average. These findings indicate that what we see plays a part in how we experience pain. Over the years, we have come to understand that pain is a protective alarm system that the body uses to alert us of a threat. This threat can arise from a multitude of sources. If we get punched in the face, tissues likely get damaged and our body produces pain since the damage has created a threat. In response, we may cover our face, go hide or seek treatment as we would like to protect ourselves. However, we can feel pain even when there is no tissue damage at all as long as our brain is perceiving something as a threat. Perhaps we are not sleeping well as we are stressed about an upcoming exam and suddenly we experience knee pain in a knee that was injured years ago but has healed since then. What if we open up the knee and find that there is absolutely no tissue damage? How is it possible that the knee is feeling any pain at all? Well the stress from the poor sleep and exam has built up and has become a threat to us as perceived by the brain which can accentuate pain from acute or chronic injuries.

In the study, the brain sees that the neck has been rotated too much and elicits a pain response in your body. This is to protect you because it believes that if you rotate too much, you will over-stress the tissue and cause further damage. The brain is likely wrong in this case but the protective system exists nonetheless. However, the brain depends on several factors before producing pain. In this case, it is clear that it is using visual feedback to create pain. Altering the visual feedback thus changes the pain sensation accordingly. In our lives, however, pain modulation goes beyond visual feedback. An eloquent analogy I picked up from Barbell Medicine is that pain is like hunger. If you just went through a break-up, you might go through a whole tub of ice cream in one sitting. If you are out with friends you might eat more as well. There are many influences on how hungry you are and the same idea goes for pain. That is why it is incredibly important that when you are evaluating your pain, consider not only what may be happening physically or biologically but also consider what is happening psychologically or socially. Family issues? Problems at work? Feeling depressed lately? All of these examples have the capacity to moderate the pain you feel and it will be unique to each person.

**TL;DR:** Pain is the product of a system run by your brain to protect you from threats. Threats can be physical, mental, emotional and social. Pain is like hunger, several things can influence either sensation. This study used virtual reality to alter what we see and by extension, change our pain experience.

Beta-alanine is likely a supplement we have all heard about and consumed especially if you use pre-workout formulas. Let’s take a look at a meta-analysis conducted by Saunders et al. (2017) to get a better idea of what beta-alanine is and to explore its effectiveness in muscle performance. A meta-analysis is essentially a process in which multiple studies are put together to consolidate all their findings into one massive study. This helps us discover relationships that would not be possible to uncover in one study alone. Before we get into the potential performance effects, let us briefly look over how beta alanine works. As we exercise, muscles become more acidic over time which results in poorer performance. Carnosine is a protein found in our muscles and it is important for several reasons, one of which is to manage how acidic or alkaline our muscles get. Carnosine is actually partly made up of beta alanine and thus beta alanine is also necessary to prevent our muscles from getting too acidic. Knowing all this, it is clear that beta alanine may have a potential benefit in boosting muscular endurance but is that really the case?

The meta-analysis found that there was a small benefit in exercise performance done over a minute and beyond. If we go below a minute - especially under 30 seconds - we do not really see any meaningful ergogenic use. This makes sense as intense activities that are short in duration will not be limited by how acidic our muscles are. The effects of beta alanine seem to be much more evident in exercises that are performed to failure rather than exercises that are not. Whether or not you are a novice or an experienced athlete, beta alanine appears to exhibit the same effects. The type of exercise also has no bearing on beta alanine and its function. The authors also did analysis on sodium bicarbonate and effects on performance when co-supplemented with beta-alanine. Sodium bicarbonate has similar mechanisms for improving endurance in that it also manages the acidity of muscles. It was discovered that sodium bicarbonate had a slightly better boost to performance when taken with beta alanine compared to taking beta alanine alone. Perhaps we can take a deeper dive into sodium bicarbonate another time as it presents some promise and other research into the compound has been done since this meta-analysis.

While there is likely a small benefit to muscular endurance when supplementing with beta alanine, it is important that these improvements are only apparent when taking doses over a period of time. Taking an acute dose, in your pre-workout for example, will do nothing for performance. The authors suggest taking 3.2-6.4 grams per day for 4 to 12 weeks with the doses spread across the day (0.8-1.6 grams every few hours). The spaces between doses help prevent the occurrence of unwanted side effects like tingling sensations.

**TL;DR:** Beta alanine likely offers a small boost to muscular endurance in activities that go beyond 30 seconds to 1 minute. You can consider supplementing with 3.2-6.4 grams per day for 4 to 12 weeks with the doses spread across the day (0.8-1.6 grams every few hours) if it is safe for you to consume.

Pain? Beta-Alanine?-Hello! There was a time awhile ago where I had posted some summaries of journal articles on general fitness.

---------------------------------------------------

Schoenfeld et al. (2022) wrote a review on the potential for stretching in between sets to be a time-efficient way to gain muscle. The theoretical basis for this novel practice consists of a few ideas. Firstly, our muscles contain many sensors that detect tension, both active and passive. We know that the active sensors are directly linked to pathways that are essential to muscle gain. We do not have much practical evidence that the passive sensors have the same links but it is possible. Other theories include flattening of the muscle cell nuclei (the control centre of the cell) and opening of specific channels in the muscle whenever we stretch. Again, this is all highly theoretical and we have yet to see any findings that explicitly demonstrate that these processes lead to muscle gain.

Upon the foundation of promising animal studies, there have been a few studies looking at humans using stretching during rest periods between sets to try to elicit more muscle gains. Unfortunately, the results are fairly equivocal when looking at the entirety of the data and most of the studies were all conducted a little differently. Van Every et al. (2022) carried out an experiment in which 21 young, untrained males performed a straight leg calf-raise on a leg press machine and a seated calf-raise for 4 sets each, twice a week for 8 weeks. If you would like to understand why they did these two exercises specifically, refer to the side-note below.

The catch in the study was that one calf would rest for 2 minutes between sets as one would usually do while the other calf would stretch for 30 seconds during the 2 minute rest period. The stretch would use the full load of their set. For example, if the participant was calf-raising 50 kilograms on the leg press, after the final repetition, they would keep the 50 kilograms on and immediately descend into a stretched position and hold it for 30 seconds. Unfortunately, the authors did not specify how “hard” the subjects should stretch. All the participants were familiarized with the exercises for a week prior to the exercise programme and they also did 10 repetition maximum testing to prescribe adequate loads. All sets were done to failure in the 8-12 repetition range. To observe muscle changes, the researchers used ultrasound scans and they also used a dynamometer to detect muscle strength adaptations. The ultrasound measures were conducted 48 hours away from exercise to prevent muscle swelling from influencing the observations.

The authors found that the soleus grew more in the calves that had been stretched during the inter-set rest periods. However, the range of differences between groups in soleus growth spans from absolutely no difference at all to a large difference. It should also be highlighted that we expect a range of error in measurement and the finding falls within this range so it is possible this difference was not real and can be attributed to lack of precision in ultrasound technique or interpretation. The strength changes were similar in that the stretch group had greater strength improvements but the variation in results was high. Other calf muscles did not demonstrate any significant differences between groups. If we assume the greater soleus growth to be true, it may be related to the soleus’ muscle architecture. It is composed of mainly type 1 fibers (low force production but high fatigue resistance) with shorter muscle fibers that are usually rather resistant to growth. While the results are not incredible, this low-risk method of training may help with the stubborn calf muscle gains and muscle growth in general.

**GETTING STARTED (FIRST 60 LBS) JUST DIET/NO LIFTING:**

Back in 2018 I was going through a lot of anxiety and I was using food as my escape binge eating on a regular basis. I always wanted to lose weight, but I could never stick to a diet. I also had a bad case of last supper effect in which I would put a future date on starting a diet (usually a Monday) and then eat anything I could get my hands on to enjoy myself before the diet. This repeated itself multiple times which is when I actually gained 30lbs within 2-3 months. I was taking anti-acid more than once a day and I would be tired all the time.

Right after Thanksgiving 2018, I decided that I needed to do something about this and my mom recommended Keto. After starting Keto, my cravings pretty much got eliminated and I felt I was happy in that diet. Of course, it helps that Keto makes you lose a good amount of water weight which is motivating when starting out. I stayed on Keto and lost 60lbs within 4 months. ([First Progress Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/progresspics/comments/b680rg/m2157_260lbs_205lbs_55lbs_4_months_still_got_ways/)) and plateaued my way at the 200 +- 10lbs for a year. I also incorporated a couple of fasting days here (16,18, 23). However, during this time I cheated on the diet multiple times so I stayed the same throughout the year.

**DEC 2019 STARTED LIFTING/COVID :**

[Pic](https://imgur.com/ZMzxt0m). I stared going to the gym with my roommate and he pretty much became my trainer and mentor at that point. At first he would pressure me to go but then I started actually liking going to the gym so it would be me the one that would pressure him. I went 3-4x per week until March 2020 when COVID hit. Diet was a disaster at this point, the gym helped lower the damage but I was still gaining weight. Then COVID hit and the gyms started to close.

**2020 SERIOUS LIFTING/COVID**

During March-June 2020 of COVID I was doing Keto and Fasting and went as far down as 180lbs but quickly yo-yoed myself back to the 190-200 range by July. The gyms started opening again which in when I started going religiously 5-6x per week. I didn't have my roommate to go with my so I got an app (FitBod) that guided me through a routine and started watching lots of videos on youtube. Here's the thing about watching videos on youtube, there's a lot of bro science out there and with time I felt more confused than ever. Wondering if I was wasting my time lifting weights while being in a deficit. I started getting overwhelmed but decided to keep at it and keep trying to lose fat and gain muscle at the same time against the advise of a lot of online ""experts"". I stayed consistent with the gym, diet was still a struggle and I was building muscle but not losing much fat.

**2021-PRESENT JUST FASTING/LIFTING**

As 2021 rolled in I stopped doing Keto. I had moved back with my friends and it was a struggle to have a social life with Keto when no one else was doing Keto. Fasting was giving me more options on what I would eat (within reason) during the window. This proved a better strategy for me at this stage and it proved successful because I lost the dreaded 30lbs to 170 here. Lifting stayed consistent here, no issues with that. Did a bit of orange theory that actually helped but sometimes I would unconsciously eat more than if I had not gone at all.

**PROGRAM**

I do push, pull, legs and switch things up but here's a sample routine. I no longer do shoulders with push because my shoulders aren't very strong so it's too much to take with chest. Instead I do shoulders with legs or on a separate day with triceps. (Note, these say 4 sets, I always do one warm up set with very little weight so it's really 3 sets). The ones that say 3 sets don't have warm ups.

**Monday - Push (Chest/Triceps)**

* 4x12-8 Barbell Bench Press
   * Warm Up: Barbell 45 lbs (8+ reps)
   * Warm Up 2: 135lbs (8 reps)
   * 155lbs (12 reps)
   * 185lbs (10 reps)
   * 205lbs (8 reps)
* 3x13-10 Dips
* 3x15+ Incline Push Up
* 3x10+ Incline Tricep Push Up (or cable overhead tricep extension)
* 4x12-8 Dumbbell Incline Bench Press (or barbell)
* 4x12-10 Dumbbell Kickbacks (or cable one arm tricep push down)
* 3x12-8 Machine Fly (or cable fly)

**Tuesday - Pull (Biceps/Back)**

* 4x8-12 Dumbbell Bicep Curls
* 2x6-10 Pull Ups
* 2x8-12 Chin Ups
* 4x12 Hanging Knee Raise (I always finish pull/chin ups with this, even it not doing abs)
* 4x8-12 Hammer Curls
* 4x12-8 Dumbbell Row (or cable row)
* 3x12 Cable double bicep curl (or ez-bar curl)

**Wednesday - Cardio/Legs**

* 4x12-8 Deadlift
* 4x12-8 Squat
* 4x12-8 Leg Extensions
* 4x12-8 Leg Curl
* 4x12-8 Machine hip adductor
* 4x12-8 Machine hip abductor
* 4x12-8 Leg Press
* 10-12 minutes Stair Master (2min 6, 2min 8, 2 min 10, then back down)
* 25 minutes HIIT Treadmill (real honest I just do a tread sample from the orange theory subreddit)

**Thursday - Shoulders/Abs/Optional Triceps**

**Friday - Push 02 - Biceps/Back**

See above. When I repeat days I do a heavy lift day with less reps more weight. The second day I'll do lots of reps and lower weight with drop sets.  Example:

* 4x18-10ish Dumbbell Bicep Curls Drop Sets
* 2x8+ Pull Ups
* 2x8+ Chin Ups
* 4x12+ Hanging Knee Raise (I always finish pull/chin ups with this, even it not doing abs)
* 4x18-12ish Hammer Curls Drop Sets
* 4x18-10ish Dumbbell Row (or cable row) drop sets
* 3x20-15 Cable double bicep curl (or ez-bar curl)

**Saturday - Rest/Repeat Legs or Chest**

**Sunday - Rest**

**DIET**

Currently I'm just doing fasting (16, 18, 23) depending on how I'm feeling. With fasting I don't have to count every single calorie but I am conscious of them. With that being said, I'm terrible at counting calories and I always underestimate. Instead, I just overestimate the calories on everything I eat. So I go to Chipotle, their website says my bowl is 1,000 calories. I count 1,200 calories.  This is how I treat calories: I love money and not spending it, so I treat calories like money. My TDEE is 2,100 calories per day. I can choose how I spend that but if I go over my daily, then now I'm in debt. If I save up today then I have some savings. If I save up 200 every day then on the weekend I can redeem that for a Crumbl cookie or something like that.

With that being said, I do pay attention to my protein intake. I eat about 120g of protein. I don't sacrifice protein for a fast. So if I need a high protein yogurt or a shake after the gym, I'll break my fast for that and only for that and then immediately ""resume the fast"".

**SUPPLEMENTS:** Creatine, Protein, Pre-workout.

**LOSE SKIN:**  It's [not too noticeable](https://imgur.com/a/qcHqPs0) but the skin is very elastic and you can tell if you pull on it or lay down. I do have stretch marks (battle scars) on my side and some white ones in the stomach but those aren’t too noticeable. If I lose a couple more pounds it would be a lot more noticeable which is why I think I'll stay in the 170 range rather than pushing to 160 (unless I can increase mass)

**MENTAL HEALTH**

Didn't want to talk about this here but it's a crucial part of my journey so I'll briefly talk about it. A drastic transformation in relatively little time is not easy mentally speaking. It's like fast forwarding in social statuses from one night to the next. You sill feel the same on the inside but everyone treats you different and like you're worth more. Women that wouldn't speak to me 2 years ago now suddenly seem interested. You start getting compliments and don't even now how to react because no one never complimented your physical appearance before. Self confidence is still catching up and doesn't happen overnight. When you spend so much time working for a goal, it can also be easy to start focusing on imperfections (body dysphormia) so that's something that I've been working on as well. The point is that the mind is a muscle and problems don't get solved overnight. Training and mental development is required and a crucial part of a transformation.",Fitness,"24/M/5'7"" 260lb to 170lbs - 4 incredible years-Hello everyone!

The gyms started opening again which in when I started going religiously 5-6x per week. I didn't have my roommate to go with my so I got an app (FitBod) that guided me through a routine and started watching lots of videos on youtube. Here's the thing about watching videos on youtube, there's a lot of bro science out there and with time I felt more confused than ever. Wondering if I was wasting my time lifting weights while being in a deficit. I started getting overwhelmed but decided to keep at it and keep trying to lose fat and gain muscle at the same time against the advise of a lot of online ""experts"". I stayed consistent with the gym, diet was still a struggle and I was building muscle but not losing much fat.

**2021-PRESENT JUST FASTING/LIFTING**

As 2021 rolled in I stopped doing Keto. I had moved back with my friends and it was a struggle to have a social life with Keto when no one else was doing Keto. Fasting was giving me more options on what I would eat (within reason) during the window. This proved a better strategy for me at this stage and it proved successful because I lost the dreaded 30lbs to 170 here. Lifting stayed consistent here, no issues with that. Did a bit of orange theory that actually helped but sometimes I would unconsciously eat more than if I had not gone at all.

**PROGRAM**

I do push, pull, legs and switch things up but here's a sample routine. I no longer do shoulders with push because my shoulders aren't very strong so it's too much to take with chest. Instead I do shoulders with legs or on a separate day with triceps. (Note, these say 4 sets, I always do one warm up set with very little weight so it's really 3 sets). The ones that say 3 sets don't have warm ups.

**Monday - Push (Chest/Triceps)**

* 4x12-8 Barbell Bench Press
   * Warm Up: Barbell 45 lbs (8+ reps)
   * Warm Up 2: 135lbs (8 reps)
   * 155lbs (12 reps)
   * 185lbs (10 reps)
   * 205lbs (8 reps)
* 3x13-10 Dips
* 3x15+ Incline Push Up
* 3x10+ Incline Tricep Push Up (or cable overhead tricep extension)
* 4x12-8 Dumbbell Incline Bench Press (or barbell)
* 4x12-10 Dumbbell Kickbacks (or cable one arm tricep push down)
* 3x12-8 Machine Fly (or cable fly)

**Tuesday - Pull (Biceps/Back)**

* 4x8-12 Dumbbell Bicep Curls
* 2x6-10 Pull Ups
* 2x8-12 Chin Ups
* 4x12 Hanging Knee Raise (I always finish pull/chin ups with this, even it not doing abs)
* 4x8-12 Hammer Curls
* 4x12-8 Dumbbell Row (or cable row)
* 3x12 Cable double bicep curl (or ez-bar curl)

**Wednesday - Cardio/Legs**

* 4x12-8 Deadlift
* 4x12-8 Squat
* 4x12-8 Leg Extensions
* 4x12-8 Leg Curl
* 4x12-8 Machine hip adductor
* 4x12-8 Machine hip abductor
* 4x12-8 Leg Press
* 10-12 minutes Stair Master (2min 6, 2min 8, 2 min 10, then back down)
* 25 minutes HIIT Treadmill (real honest I just do a tread sample from the orange theory subreddit)

**Thursday - Shoulders/Abs/Optional Triceps**

**Friday - Push 02 - Biceps/Back**

See above. When I repeat days I do a heavy lift day with less reps more weight. The second day I'll do lots of reps and lower weight with drop sets.  Example:

* 4x18-10ish Dumbbell Bicep Curls Drop Sets
* 2x8+ Pull Ups
* 2x8+ Chin Ups
* 4x12+ Hanging Knee Raise (I always finish pull/chin ups with this, even it not doing abs)
* 4x18-12ish Hammer Curls Drop Sets
* 4x18-10ish Dumbbell Row (or cable row) drop sets
* 3x20-15 Cable double bicep curl (or ez-bar curl)

**Saturday - Rest/Repeat Legs or Chest**

**Sunday - Rest**

**DIET**

Currently I'm just doing fasting (16, 18, 23) depending on how I'm feeling. With fasting I don't have to count every single calorie but I am conscious of them. With that being said, I'm terrible at counting calories and I always underestimate. Instead, I just overestimate the calories on everything I eat. So I go to Chipotle, their website says my bowl is 1,000 calories. I count 1,200 calories.  This is how I treat calories: I love money and not spending it, so I treat calories like money. My TDEE is 2,100 calories per day. I can choose how I spend that but if I go over my daily, then now I'm in debt. If I save up today then I have some savings. If I save up 200 every day then on the weekend I can redeem that for a Crumbl cookie or something like that.

With that being said, I do pay attention to my protein intake. I eat about 120g of protein. I don't sacrifice protein for a fast. So if I need a high protein yogurt or a shake after the gym, I'll break my fast for that and only for that and then immediately ""resume the fast"".

**SUPPLEMENTS:** Creatine, Protein, Pre-workout.

**LOSE SKIN:**  It's [not too noticeable](https://imgur.com/a/qcHqPs0) but the skin is very elastic and you can tell if you pull on it or lay down. I do have stretch marks (battle scars) on my side and some white ones in the stomach but those aren’t too noticeable. If I lose a couple more pounds it would be a lot more noticeable which is why I think I'll stay in the 170 range rather than pushing to 160 (unless I can increase mass)

**MENTAL HEALTH**

Didn't want to talk about this here but it's a crucial part of my journey so I'll briefly talk about it. A drastic transformation in relatively little time is not easy mentally speaking. It's like fast forwarding in social statuses from one night to the next. You sill feel the same on the inside but everyone treats you different and like you're worth more. Women that wouldn't speak to me 2 years ago now suddenly seem interested. You start getting compliments and don't even now how to react because no one never complimented your physical appearance before. Self confidence is still catching up and doesn't happen overnight. When you spend so much time working for a goal, it can also be easy to start focusing on imperfections (body dysphormia) so that's something that I've been working on as well. The point is that the mind is a muscle and problems don't get solved overnight. Training and mental development is required and a crucial part of a transformation."

obligatory to start: yes, i have spoken to my doctor, and we have discussed which equipment and workouts are safe for me.

the thing is, i could really benefit from using my local gym as a resource, but i use a rollator walker. i don't really know how to be polite and out of the way, as i will need it beside me to help me transfer between equipment. i would leave it up front with staff if i could.

are there specific disabled sections in gyms for people with mobility aides? or is there usually enough room between equipment that i shouldn't worry? as far as i can remember, i have seen treadmills and the like really close together, but this was before COVID. would people consider it rude for my walker to be beside me and ""in the way""? i haven't been in a gym since my diagnosis, so i just don't know how things will work.

i will definitely ask staff questions when i get the courage to try, i just honestly doubt there is much of a 'game plan' at any gym for people in my position. if anyone has experience or can help me know what to expect, please comment!! i have been exercising more, slowly, at home and outdoors, but my worries are keeping me from seeking out the gym.

here's to hoping r/disabilityfitness opens up again soon so i can crosspost there.",Fitness,"ettiquette while using a mobility aide at the gym?-UPDATE: hi! thank you for all the nice comments! many of you are helpful! however, please do not call me inspiring or motivating! this contributes to something called ""Inspiration Porn"" and is frowned upon by many disabled people including myself. please look up the term if you are not familiar! i came for advice, not to be touted as an inspiration and it can be a little disheartening. thank you, much love!

2022-11-16 05:47:34,How to optimize glute-focused workouts with glute activation,"Hi! On leg and glute-centered days, I try to incorporate glute activation exercises before lifting -  unweighted fire hydrants, kick backs, donkey kicks, and side leg circles. I want to be effective in activating the muscle I'm training but I'm really confused about the necessity of glute activation, the extent of it and many reps I should aim for with activation.

Does progressive overload apply to glute activation too? How much activation is necessary?

 I've also seen and heard of people doing around 3 sets of 30 reps with activation (of the glute activation exercises mentioned above) - is this generally acceptable? The purpose of glute activation isn't to exhaust your glutes so how do you know when you've sufficiently activated those muscles to avoid overworking them with a workout and lifting after?",Fitness,"How to optimize glute-focused workouts with glute activation-Hi!

2022-11-10 20:38:26,Flesh & Metal Program Overview/Review,"I am wrapping up three months of bulking while running my flexible program Flesh & Metal. I caught covid in the last weeks which killed momentum and put me in a little bit of a limbo while I prepared for a cutting period but I still accumulated enough positive results to call the program a success. This write up will cover my results, an overview of the program as I suggest others use it, and a recap of my three month run. Flesh & Metal is appropriate for lifters of any strength level, but requires the user to make decisions pertaining to movements used and accessory work. It is a flexible programming approach which means it can be made to work for a wide variety of training goals and situations but it will not tell you explicitly what to do, so it may not be appropriate for trainees without a basic understanding of what works for them yet.

I don’t have before and after photos, [I am already huge]( https://imgur.com/a/83FQOmX), so I do not gain significant muscle from each bulk anymore, I am lucky to be a couple pounds heavier every *year* at this point. Bulk just puts on a few BF% for the most part and a sliver of muscle. You’ll have to trust me that I know what needs to be done to gain muscle and that this program enables that. 
If all of this doesn’t convince you that I probably know what I am doing then you do not need to keep reading if you don’t want to. I won’t be upset. 

**The Program**:

To give the brief elevator pitch, Flesh & Metal (F&M) is a loosely structured training methodology meant to be easily molded. It can be run with any set up, for any length of time, and can focus on whatever you need it to. Its core philosophy is to push for a PR in your current movements every session then move on to new movements when you hit a plateau. The ‘program’ leaves many choices, including what those movements are, what your accessory work is, how many days you want to train, and many other areas up to the user. It is meant to be more of an inspiration/driving force rather than a comprehensive program, and thus might not be appropriate for newer lifters who do not have experience handling these areas for themselves. 

***Progression Scheme:*** 

F&M is centered around two core movements each day. The progression scheme for your core movements is as follows:

-Select your primary movement, and on its initial session push it for a hard set at a weight/rep range of your choice. This set should probably not end in grinding reps, you want a pretty clean set as a starting point. 

-For each subsequent session with this movement, you must achieve a PR in one or more of these ways: increased reps, increased weight, or increase in estimated 1RM (this option is only available if the weight is increased, you can use whatever calculator/formula you want, just be consistent).

-Continue to advance the movement every session until you fail to achieve a PR by the above standards. When this happens, the movement is relegated to the ‘secondary’ position, and your current secondary movement (if you have one), is dropped entirely. 

-Choose a new primary movement for the next session, and lather, rinse, repeat. 

***Session/Weekly Structure:***

Every session will start with your primary movement. Build up to and complete the PR attempt top set. I suggest including either build up, or back off sets for the primary movement. These should be relatively easy, compared to the top set. I suggest going with ~1/2 the reps you will be attempting for the top set, using the top set weight. 2-4 of these sets is probably fine. After this you will move to the secondary movement. Here you just want the 2-4 straight sets, at roughly 80% what your best PR was. This can be 80% weight, or reps, or something in between. The point is to have hard but doable sets, the goal here being to ‘lock in’ what you developed when pushing the movement for PRs. After these core movements you will perform your chosen accessory work.

How many days a week you train is up to you, but I recommend having a separate set of primary/secondary movements for every 2 days you train. For example, a 4 day structure would look [something like this]( https://imgur.com/a/Cb46iSY)

I think that in most cases 4 or 6 sessions a week is the right choice for this program. But odd numbers are doable, just keep moving down the ABABAB or ABCABCABC pattern regardless of the day of the week. You can also incorporate days that are not part of the program. For example you could run 2 or 4 F&M days a week and then several days of something else. 

When choosing movements choose variations you are not super familiar with, or have not focused on in a long time. One of the main purposes for this methodology is to take advantage of rapid potential for improvement when learning, or refreshing, a movement, and the fact that it provides a wide variety of stimuli. Rotating a small pool of movements or movements you frequently work is not in line with this. Simple variants, like using a new bar, or a different grip, or a different Range of Motion, are all good ways to achieve this without going to completely new movements. 

I think that keeping a pairing of upper body primary with lower body secondary, and vice versa, is the best practice here, but you are free to go against that if you wish to adhere to a more rigid split. Similarly, keeping each session's movements in a similar pattern, such as the example week with Overhead Press paired with a Hinge, and a Horizontal Press paired with a Squat, is a good idea too. This helps ensure you are not performing similar movement patterns on back to back days. 

***Rationale:***

F&M is set up as it is for several reasons:

-Versatility: this is a program that has zero equipment requirements/limitations, can be made to fit a training block of any length, and can fulfill any general training needs. It will not prepare you for specific goals as well as a more specialized program but can be molded to fit anyone’s ‘off season’. 

-Sustainability: By the very nature of this program sustained plateaus will not happen. You can run this program indefinitely and you will never run into a wall. Granted, this opens up the possibility to sandbag and spin your wheels, but that is a possibility in most any program, even if this one won’t rub your face in it. 

-Injury Prevention: I pretty firmly believe that injury is primarily the result of overuse in the form of long-term load mismanagement. While a specific incident might push an area over the edge into injury, there is almost always a building issue in that area that precipitates that incident. By regularly cycling movements it is much more difficult to overwork specific areas to the point of injury, as they are not being pounded by the same stimuli day in and day out. 

Novelty: By incorporating so many movement patterns into your training you are likely to be choosing some that work your body in ways it has not worked before, or at least in ways that it does not get worked frequently. This can help develop undertrained areas you were not even aware you had. 

***General Suggestions:***

-This program is appropriate for either a bulk or a cut, but choose your degree of accessory volume and/or the intensity of your build up/back off and secondary sets appropriately. When cutting these all should be lower, when bulking higher. 

-Do not go as hard as possible every session on the top set of your primary movement. You will reach the point of grinding soon enough, don’t speed that process. Doing so will not only force you to switch movements more rapidly, but also lose some of the inherent periodization of the program which could interfere with fatigue management. Your goal should be to chip your previous PR, not blow it out of the water. 

-If you do feel that fatigue is eclipsing your recovery, consider choosing movements that are more technically or mechanically challenging for a while, as they will require lower absolute loads and will likely cause less overall fatigue. 

-Consider tracking at least your primary movements in a notebook or spreadsheet. You will be setting a lot of PRs while running this program, and you might want to be able to reference them later. 

***Inspirations:***

This program has multiple inspirations, and unlike someone claiming that their programming is totally novel (it’s not) I will gladly talk about them. 

-Average To Savage 2.0, Greg Nuckols: I think that A2S2 is one of the best general-purpose programs out there. After running it in 2020 the combination of a lower and an upper body compound a day, and the incorporation of multiple variants as primary movements really stuck with me. Its approach of buildup/back off sets with a singular top set is not unique, but this was the program that exposed me to it. 

-The Wisconsin Method, Eric Bugenhagen: This is relatively obscure, and frankly the information is so scattered and that I cannot really point to anything or guarantee that I am properly attributing the ideas, but the concepts were presented to me with this name and attributed to the Bugez. In short, it’s the same basic principle, but with even less structure and more Bugez intensanity. My main takeaway was the idea of pushing to PR every time and moving onto a new movement when you failed to do so was from these various posts/videos. 

-Many Other People: It would take a while to list them all, and I would probably miss some, but there are a lot of people who helped put the idea of expanding your scope for PRs, training with high variation, and putting your focus on training hard and constantly rather than getting lost in specifics and living in a world of %s and Squat, Bench, Dead. Everything that I write to you is inspired in part or in full by those around me (usually in a metaphorical sense, as most of it is online interaction). I just aim to collect this wisdom, internalize it, then release it into the wild with my own spin so that it might spread farther and continue the cycle. 

**Recap of my Run:**

I ran F&M for just shy of three months, with covid messing up the planned weeks 12 and 13. My weekly structure was as follows:

-Monday: F&M, Overhead Press/Hip Hinge Core Movements

-Tuesday: F&M, Horizontal Press/Squat Core Movements 

-Wednesday: Upper Body Hypertrophy 

-Thursday: F&M, Overhead Press/Hip Hinge Core Movements

-Friday: F&M, Horizontal Press/Squat Core Movements 

-Saturday: Lower Body Hypertrophy 

-Sunday: Arm Hypertrophy 

The core movements I worked through were: 

-Overhead Press: Clean and Jerk, Behind the Neck Strict Press

-Hip Hinge: Zercher Deadlift, Single Leg Deadlift (Frame)

-Horizontal Press: Larsen Press, Slingshot Bench

-Squat: Marrs Bar Box Squat 

[Here is the whole tracking spreadsheet of weights used/reps achieved]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n64f9XNKrNDfAXWTqGisgpTBsHq0_VY0ojnt2Zb_34k/edit?usp=sharing)

Accessory Movements were fairly minimal on F&M days. Training every day requires acceptance that some days won’t have a ton of work. I went in *intending* to follow a similar Upper, Lower, Arms pattern with one day off accessory work but ended up just hitting each day however I wanted. 

As I am wont to do, I went off and maxed weird stuff instead of accessories on many days, but I completed at least the primary movement on nearly every scheduled day. My adherence to the secondary movement was hit or miss. I do believe it is a good idea, so this is an area of do as I say not as I do. I doubt many of you are as inclined to explore the depths of esoteric and Avant Garde lifts so you will probably not have to worry about being distracted by a Yoke Arthur Clean. 

The hypertrophy days were performed at a local commercial gym. I like the pattern of including three days at the gym dedicated to hypertrophy work in my bulks. It keeps me from getting too far off track doing weird shit, as the ultimate goal of every bulk is to milk whatever extra muscle gain I can. A guarantee of three days a week where I focus on getting the volume in boring lifts needed to do that goes a long way towards meeting that goal.
 I also like the large variety of machines available at the gym. I am a firm believer in the value of machines to accumulate additional, more focused, volume for muscle groups you want to grow. Fixed movement patterns let you hit the muscles you want despite fatigue, and let you circumvent the smaller muscle groups/joints/connective tissues that can be beaten up with free weight work. People who completely eschew machine work in their training because they believe it’s inferior are silly. Machines have value for every kind of lifting related goal. 

Upper Body Days are general alternating movements for back and chest, usually following a pattern of heavier/more compound to lighter/more isolative, shoulder finishers included at the end when I remember. As example, an upper body day might look like Smith Machine Press, Heavy Single Arm Chest Supported Row, Converging Chest Press Machine, Lat Pulldown, Chest Fly, Cable Lateral Raises. Most of these end up in the 10-20 rep range. Not because I believe that range is special, it’s just what feels best for me. 3-4 sets per movement. 

Lower Body Days follow a pretty defined pattern for me these days. Leg Curls, building from warmup to a heavy top set. Leg Press or Hack Squat, which is just a single heavy top set with intensity modifier (drop set, rest pause set, cluster set, etc. Basically, anything that takes the set past traditional failure). Then I get sets of cable crunches, these are super useful because depending on the day I might have a serious lower back pump from the previous work, cable crunches do a good job of cooling that area down. Then I work obligatory calf work and finish up with a quad focused isolation like leg extensions or Bulgarian split squats. 

Arm Days are just 3 sets of Bi/Tri movements alternated. I incorporate a dedicated arm day in my bulks because arms (at least mine) need the dedicated work and because it’s a very low fatigue day, which is valuable when I am trying to maintain 7 workouts a week. I don’t have many specifics to cover here, I am not someone to be asking about growing arms. 

I walk 3 miles twice a day with my dog as general LISS cardio, I think that getting extra walking in is pure upside regardless of how you are training/what your goals are. Helps with recovery by getting blood moving and helps maintain an effortless cardiovascular base. I also row a 5k a couple times a week when bulking, in contrast to almost every night when cutting. It fulfills the need for slightly more intense cardio. 

I eat over 6000 calories a day to support all of this activity at my size (6’5’’ 265lbs +/-10). As I figure someone will ask if I don’t mention this. All of which is solid food. 

**Conclusion:**

I am glad that this loose form program panned out. I can now add it to my tiny but growing library of programming options that I have been building up. While I probably don’t personally need to write out and structure my programming ideas to make them work for me, doing it helps me better understand *why* I do the things I do, and thus more easily communicate the ideas to others. If what I have presented here has sparked your interest I have a largeish library of write ups including [long]( https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1dZdILLezOnR9UWXK6w8tW29SgFJNzyyw) and [longer]( https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1koNt2c_o4TN74QyGgm7bEKU9tRiQUuCb) writings.

**The Program**:

To give the brief elevator pitch, Flesh & Metal (F&M) is a loosely structured training methodology meant to be easily molded. It can be run with any set up, for any length of time, and can focus on whatever you need it to. Its core philosophy is to push for a PR in your current movements every session then move on to new movements when you hit a plateau. The ‘program’ leaves many choices, including what those movements are, what your accessory work is, how many days you want to train, and many other areas up to the user. It is meant to be more of an inspiration/driving force rather than a comprehensive program, and thus might not be appropriate for newer lifters who do not have experience handling these areas for themselves. 

***Progression Scheme:*** 

F&M is centered around two core movements each day. The progression scheme for your core movements is as follows:

-Select your primary movement, and on its initial session push it for a hard set at a weight/rep range of your choice. This set should probably not end in grinding reps, you want a pretty clean set as a starting point. 

-For each subsequent session with this movement, you must achieve a PR in one or more of these ways: increased reps, increased weight, or increase in estimated 1RM (this option is only available if the weight is increased, you can use whatever calculator/formula you want, just be consistent).

-Continue to advance the movement every session until you fail to achieve a PR by the above standards. When this happens, the movement is relegated to the ‘secondary’ position, and your current secondary movement (if you have one), is dropped entirely. 

-Choose a new primary movement for the next session, and lather, rinse, repeat. 

***Session/Weekly Structure:***

Every session will start with your primary movement. Build up to and complete the PR attempt top set. I suggest including either build up, or back off sets for the primary movement. These should be relatively easy, compared to the top set. I suggest going with ~1/2 the reps you will be attempting for the top set, using the top set weight. 2-4 of these sets is probably fine. After this you will move to the secondary movement. Here you just want the 2-4 straight sets, at roughly 80% what your best PR was. This can be 80% weight, or reps, or something in between. The point is to have hard but doable sets, the goal here being to ‘lock in’ what you developed when pushing the movement for PRs. After these core movements you will perform your chosen accessory work.

How many days a week you train is up to you, but I recommend having a separate set of primary/secondary movements for every 2 days you train. For example, a 4 day structure would look [something like this]( https://imgur.com/a/Cb46iSY)

I think that in most cases 4 or 6 sessions a week is the right choice for this program. But odd numbers are doable, just keep moving down the ABABAB or ABCABCABC pattern regardless of the day of the week. You can also incorporate days that are not part of the program. For example you could run 2 or 4 F&M days a week and then several days of something else. 

When choosing movements choose variations you are not super familiar with, or have not focused on in a long time. One of the main purposes for this methodology is to take advantage of rapid potential for improvement when learning, or refreshing, a movement, and the fact that it provides a wide variety of stimuli. Rotating a small pool of movements or movements you frequently work is not in line with this. Simple variants, like using a new bar, or a different grip, or a different Range of Motion, are all good ways to achieve this without going to completely new movements. 

I think that keeping a pairing of upper body primary with lower body secondary, and vice versa, is the best practice here, but you are free to go against that if you wish to adhere to a more rigid split. Similarly, keeping each session's movements in a similar pattern, such as the example week with Overhead Press paired with a Hinge, and a Horizontal Press paired with a Squat, is a good idea too. This helps ensure you are not performing similar movement patterns on back to back days. 

***Rationale:***

F&M is set up as it is for several reasons:

-Versatility: this is a program that has zero equipment requirements/limitations, can be made to fit a training block of any length, and can fulfill any general training needs. It will not prepare you for specific goals as well as a more specialized program but can be molded to fit anyone’s ‘off season’. 

-Sustainability: By the very nature of this program sustained plateaus will not happen. You can run this program indefinitely and you will never run into a wall. Granted, this opens up the possibility to sandbag and spin your wheels, but that is a possibility in most any program, even if this one won’t rub your face in it. 

-Injury Prevention: I pretty firmly believe that injury is primarily the result of overuse in the form of long-term load mismanagement. While a specific incident might push an area over the edge into injury, there is almost always a building issue in that area that precipitates that incident. By regularly cycling movements it is much more difficult to overwork specific areas to the point of injury, as they are not being pounded by the same stimuli day in and day out. 

Novelty: By incorporating so many movement patterns into your training you are likely to be choosing some that work your body in ways it has not worked before, or at least in ways that it does not get worked frequently. This can help develop undertrained areas you were not even aware you had. 

***General Suggestions:***

-This program is appropriate for either a bulk or a cut, but choose your degree of accessory volume and/or the intensity of your build up/back off and secondary sets appropriately. When cutting these all should be lower, when bulking higher. 

-Do not go as hard as possible every session on the top set of your primary movement. You will reach the point of grinding soon enough, don’t speed that process. Doing so will not only force you to switch movements more rapidly, but also lose some of the inherent periodization of the program which could interfere with fatigue management. Your goal should be to chip your previous PR, not blow it out of the water. 

-If you do feel that fatigue is eclipsing your recovery, consider choosing movements that are more technically or mechanically challenging for a while, as they will require lower absolute loads and will likely cause less overall fatigue. 

-Consider tracking at least your primary movements in a notebook or spreadsheet. You will be setting a lot of PRs while running this program, and you might want to be able to reference them later. 

***Inspirations:***

This program has multiple inspirations, and unlike someone claiming that their programming is totally novel (it’s not) I will gladly talk about them. 

-Average To Savage 2.0, Greg Nuckols: I think that A2S2 is one of the best general-purpose programs out there. After running it in 2020 the combination of a lower and an upper body compound a day, and the incorporation of multiple variants as primary movements really stuck with me. Its approach of buildup/back off sets with a singular top set is not unique, but this was the program that exposed me to it. 

-The Wisconsin Method, Eric Bugenhagen: This is relatively obscure, and frankly the information is so scattered and that I cannot really point to anything or guarantee that I am properly attributing the ideas, but the concepts were presented to me with this name and attributed to the Bugez. In short, it’s the same basic principle, but with even less structure and more Bugez intensanity. My main takeaway was the idea of pushing to PR every time and moving onto a new movement when you failed to do so was from these various posts/videos. 

-Many Other People: It would take a while to list them all, and I would probably miss some, but there are a lot of people who helped put the idea of expanding your scope for PRs, training with high variation, and putting your focus on training hard and constantly rather than getting lost in specifics and living in a world of %s and Squat, Bench, Dead. Everything that I write to you is inspired in part or in full by those around me (usually in a metaphorical sense, as most of it is online interaction). I just aim to collect this wisdom, internalize it, then release it into the wild with my own spin so that it might spread farther and continue the cycle. 

**Recap of my Run:**

I ran F&M for just shy of three months, with covid messing up the planned weeks 12 and 13. My weekly structure was as follows:

-Monday: F&M, Overhead Press/Hip Hinge Core Movements

-Tuesday: F&M, Horizontal Press/Squat Core Movements 

-Wednesday: Upper Body Hypertrophy 

-Thursday: F&M, Overhead Press/Hip Hinge Core Movements

-Friday: F&M, Horizontal Press/Squat Core Movements 

-Saturday: Lower Body Hypertrophy 

-Sunday: Arm Hypertrophy 

The core movements I worked through were: 

-Overhead Press: Clean and Jerk, Behind the Neck Strict Press

-Hip Hinge: Zercher Deadlift, Single Leg Deadlift (Frame)

-Horizontal Press: Larsen Press, Slingshot Bench

-Squat: Marrs Bar Box Squat 

[Here is the whole tracking spreadsheet of weights used/reps achieved]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n64f9XNKrNDfAXWTqGisgpTBsHq0_VY0ojnt2Zb_34k/edit?usp=sharing)

Accessory Movements were fairly minimal on F&M days. Training every day requires acceptance that some days won’t have a ton of work. I went in *intending* to follow a similar Upper, Lower, Arms pattern with one day off accessory work but ended up just hitting each day however I wanted. 

As I am wont to do, I went off and maxed weird stuff instead of accessories on many days, but I completed at least the primary movement on nearly every scheduled day. My adherence to the secondary movement was hit or miss. I do believe it is a good idea, so this is an area of do as I say not as I do. I doubt many of you are as inclined to explore the depths of esoteric and Avant Garde lifts so you will probably not have to worry about being distracted by a Yoke Arthur Clean. 

The hypertrophy days were performed at a local commercial gym. I like the pattern of including three days at the gym dedicated to hypertrophy work in my bulks. It keeps me from getting too far off track doing weird shit, as the ultimate goal of every bulk is to milk whatever extra muscle gain I can. A guarantee of three days a week where I focus on getting the volume in boring lifts needed to do that goes a long way towards meeting that goal.
 I also like the large variety of machines available at the gym. I am a firm believer in the value of machines to accumulate additional, more focused, volume for muscle groups you want to grow. Fixed movement patterns let you hit the muscles you want despite fatigue, and let you circumvent the smaller muscle groups/joints/connective tissues that can be beaten up with free weight work. People who completely eschew machine work in their training because they believe it’s inferior are silly. Machines have value for every kind of lifting related goal. 

Upper Body Days are general alternating movements for back and chest, usually following a pattern of heavier/more compound to lighter/more isolative, shoulder finishers included at the end when I remember. As example, an upper body day might look like Smith Machine Press, Heavy Single Arm Chest Supported Row, Converging Chest Press Machine, Lat Pulldown, Chest Fly, Cable Lateral Raises. Most of these end up in the 10-20 rep range. Not because I believe that range is special, it’s just what feels best for me. 3-4 sets per movement. 

Lower Body Days follow a pretty defined pattern for me these days. Leg Curls, building from warmup to a heavy top set. Leg Press or Hack Squat, which is just a single heavy top set with intensity modifier (drop set, rest pause set, cluster set, etc. Basically, anything that takes the set past traditional failure). Then I get sets of cable crunches, these are super useful because depending on the day I might have a serious lower back pump from the previous work, cable crunches do a good job of cooling that area down. Then I work obligatory calf work and finish up with a quad focused isolation like leg extensions or Bulgarian split squats. 

Arm Days are just 3 sets of Bi/Tri movements alternated. I incorporate a dedicated arm day in my bulks because arms (at least mine) need the dedicated work and because it’s a very low fatigue day, which is valuable when I am trying to maintain 7 workouts a week. I don’t have many specifics to cover here, I am not someone to be asking about growing arms. 

I walk 3 miles twice a day with my dog as general LISS cardio, I think that getting extra walking in is pure upside regardless of how you are training/what your goals are. Helps with recovery by getting blood moving and helps maintain an effortless cardiovascular base. I also row a 5k a couple times a week when bulking, in contrast to almost every night when cutting. It fulfills the need for slightly more intense cardio. 

I eat over 6000 calories a day to support all of this activity at my size (6’5’’ 265lbs +/-10). As I figure someone will ask if I don’t mention this. All of which is solid food. 

**Conclusion:**

I am glad that this loose form program panned out. I can now add it to my tiny but growing library of programming options that I have been building up. While I probably don’t personally need to write out and structure my programming ideas to make them work for me, doing it helps me better understand *why* I do the things I do, and thus more easily communicate the ideas to others. If what I have presented here has sparked your interest I have a largeish library of write ups including [long]( https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1dZdILLezOnR9UWXK6w8tW29SgFJNzyyw) and [longer]( https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1koNt2c_o4TN74QyGgm7bEKU9tRiQUuCb) writings. A lot of ideas briefly touched on here have dedicated writings in those folders. I hope something here has been useful to you, and that it was worth your time to read it all."

2022-11-07 02:22:42,What to prioritize given severe time constraints,"Hi /r/fitness.

First time posting here. I have very, very little free time for a variety of reasons (primarily the fact that both my wife and I work full time and we have three young children -- 2, 4, and 6).

Do you have any advice or recommend any resources for how to prioritize workouts starting from the least amount of time available and building up from there?

For example, what kind of workouts should I prioritize if I only have 30 minutes vs 60 minutes vs 90 minutes a week to exercise? What kind of workouts should I prioritize if I only have 5 minutes a day vs 10 minutes a day vs 15 minutes a day?

I want to have a baseline that I commit to and slowly build up from but keep that baseline as a fallback for when my schedule gets really hectic.

My goals are primarily weight loss, general fitness, and longevity. I'm 37. I'd like to lose around 40 pounds.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

2022-11-04 16:41:53,"29/M/5'10"" 410+ lb to 263 lb","Hey guys,

Long time lurker first time poster here in r/Fitness. 

A brief background on myself and my fitness experience: 

My entire life up until my sophomore year of college I played sports. Mainly football and baseball with some powerlifting sprinkled in during the offseason. During my years in college I studied for and completed my Masters of Exercise Physiology. I spent the few years after college competing in powerlifting and helping others improve their strength and overall fitness. Fast forward 4-5 years and I fell off VERY hard. Started avoiding the gym, eating terrible food and just isolating myself. It took me until around 1/1/2021 to finally get myself together and make a change. The heaviest weight I saw on the scale was 410 pounds but that was after getting back in the gym for 2 months! 

I am fortunate that I have the knowledge of how to train as well as the knowledge of how to lose weight which I why I wanted to share my story so far with you guys!

**WEIGHT:**

410lb (186KG) to 263lb (119.5KG)

The timeframe for this process so far is 1/1/2021 through today, 11/4/2022  


**LIFT PROGRESS SUMMARY**

On 10/28/2021 I suffered a full thickness tear in my left pec. This tear took place at the musculotendinous junction and after discussing with my doctor we both decided surgery was not the best option at this time. At the time of the tear I was down from 410+ pounds to around 330 pounds. 

**Deadlift (Conventional):** 605lb (275kg) to 675lb (306.8.5kg)

**Deadlift (Trap Bar):** 650lb (295kg) to 815lb (370kg)

**Bench (Pre tear):** 405lb (184kg) to 505lb (229kg)

**Bench (Post tear):** 95lb (43kg) to 415lb (188.6kg)

**OHP:** 225lb (102kg) to 345lb (156kg)

**Squat:** 605lb (275kg) to 705lb (320kg)

&#x200B;

**PROGRAM**

As many of you know the number one factor that determines metabolic rate is the amount of lean mass, mainly lean muscle mass, that you are holding. Because of this fact, my goal for this process was simple, build as much muscle as possible while also eating as clean as possible. I knew this would not be a fast process, but I also knew that this method would be the most sustainable and over time produce the best results.

I did not follow a strict split or even a strict workout routine, but rather I set frequency goals and stuck to them. The template for my routine is as follows:

* Resistance training 6 days / week
* Cardio 6 days / week
* Rest 1 day/ week (with light 30 min walk)

As for duration and muscle group frequency:

* Each lift is between 1.5-2 hours
* I always take AT LEAST 48 hours between training a muscle
* Cardio is typically 60 minutes per day (treadmill, stepper, elliptical) unless it is leg day, then cardio is 30 minutes
* I always try to do legs 2x per week.

Types of exercises:

* I stick to standard hypertrophy style movements and rep ranges (5x10, 5x12, 3x15, etc)
* In addition to the hypertrophy style movements I also try to do at least one power movement per workout (bench, squat, dead, ohp, row, etc) 

&#x200B;

**DIET**

As someone who has tried and failed to lose weight more times than I can count I knew this would be both the hardest part as well as the most important part. For me I KNEW reducing calories works. I've done it before and I have seen the results. But the hardest part for me was sticking with it. That is why I knew that in order to be successful this time around I had to choose a meal routine that is both effective and sustainable. Hence why I kept this part so simple. 

I aimed to intake around 85-90% of my maintain calories, aka a 10-15% deficit. Every Friday I would recalculate my TDEE then subtract 10-15% off the top of it. That would be my daily calorie goal for the week.

After I was down my first 100 pounds I started allowing myself weekly cheat meals on Saturdays. These meals ranged from sushi to Mexican to a few beers lol! 

&#x200B;

**END**

Thanks so much for reading all the way through. I still have so much work left in order to reach my goals but I also know how hard it is to get out there and get started which is why I wanted to make this post. I know what it is like to step back in the gym unable to do the things you once were able to do easily. I know what it is like to be so disgusted with yourself that you don't even want your picture taken. I get it. But I just want to show that despite all that, if you have faith in yourself and you remain consistent that you truly can make a change!!

2022-11-02 14:55:28,"Do you need information, or do you need reassurance?"," 

I want to start by saying very clearly that this is not coming from a place of judgment. It is normal and healthy to need validation and reassurance. Most people have at least a few hangups about how attractive they are, their health, their athletic ability, or some other fitness-related traits. In many cases, your own negative self-perception is reinforced by the people around you, either through outright insults or well-meaning but hurtful comments. It is very much ok to seek out validation that you’re doing the right thing.

I’m putting this question out in the hopes that it helps people do some introspection and ask questions in a way that gets them helpful answers. In both the dailies and in many of the often-deleted self posts this sub gets every day, we get a lot of questions that boil down to some form of the following:

* “Here’s my progress. Is it good enough? Is it normal?”
* “Here’s a body part that I’m struggling to make progress on. Does it look weird?”
* “Here’s how I’m training. Did I fuck it up? Am I going to fail, or injure myself?”

When these questions come up, occasionally the answer is a simple, actionable response. Maybe your progress is slow because you missed some fundamental detail in your initial plan. Maybe that body part isn’t progressing because you aren’t training it enough. Maybe your training plan is a little vague or not right for your goals and needs adjustment.

More often though, people asking these questions seem to be looking for validation. If you’re not sure whether you’re looking for validation or a basic solution to a problem, I’d think through the following questions:

* If I got a clear and direct answer to this question, would it cause me to change what I’m doing in a meaningful way, or would it more change how I *feel* about what I’m doing?
* What is motivating me to ask? Am I asking out of curiosity? Am I asking out of a desire for self-improvement? Am I asking because I’m ashamed of something about my body? Do I consciously know I’m doing the right thing but lack the confidence to internalize that?

I realize this can be messy. If you’re new to fitness, often a question falls into both categories. If you do some reflection and realize that what you’re looking for is largely validation, though, a fitness subreddit may not always be the best place to get it. If this is where you are, I’d suggest trying a few things.

Start with the people close to you. Are you surrounded by people who demean or insult your body, or that you feel pity or condescend to you? Try discussing your struggles with them and see if you can set some boundaries around your body. If you can’t, you may not necessarily need to cut them out of your life, but it may also be time to build some new relationships with people who genuinely like and respect you. This probably sounds a bit glib, because it’s one of the most fundamentally difficult parts of growing up and of adulthood in general, but it’s also some of the most important work you’ll ever do. Working on self esteem is great, but self esteem doesn’t come exclusively from within, and you need people in your life who you can trust to be supportive.

If you have the resources, seek therapy. Again, probably sounds a bit dismissive and glib, but having a strategy for building yourself up emotionally is incredibly helpful, and a therapist who you trust is often the best qualified person to work on that plan with you.

If you’re a little shaky on both information *and* reassurance, and you have the resources, you might want to consider a strength and conditioning coach. You need to be careful in who you select, because the personal training industry can be predatory and feed on reinforcing your anxieties, but a good coach will both teach you how to train and help build your confidence in your ability to do so. For a beginner, a good coach’s job is about 10% providing information and guidance, and 90% reinforcing good habits and building your confidence.

As a final takeaway, just try to remember a few things: You don’t usually have to give up on your fitness goals in order to be kind to yourself and accepting of your current body. Bodies are resilient and adaptable. It’s ok to try something that you’re unsure of and fail. Injuries don’t happen all the time, but they do eventually happen to almost everyone, even people who don’t train at all, and in almost all cases you will recover and adapt.

Anyways, I hope this helps.",Fitness,"Do you need information, or do you need reassurance?-

In both the dailies and in many of the often-deleted self posts this sub gets every day, we get a lot of questions that boil down to some form of the following:

* “Here’s my progress. Is it good enough? Is it normal?”
* “Here’s a body part that I’m struggling to make progress on. Does it look weird?”
* “Here’s how I’m training. Did I fuck it up? Am I going to fail, or injure myself?”

When these questions come up, occasionally the answer is a simple, actionable response. Maybe your progress is slow because you missed some fundamental detail in your initial plan. Maybe that body part isn’t progressing because you aren’t training it enough. Maybe your training plan is a little vague or not right for your goals and needs adjustment.

More often though, people asking these questions seem to be looking for validation. If you’re not sure whether you’re looking for validation or a basic solution to a problem, I’d think through the following questions:

* If I got a clear and direct answer to this question, would it cause me to change what I’m doing in a meaningful way, or would it more change how I *feel* about what I’m doing?
* What is motivating me to ask? Am I asking out of curiosity? Am I asking out of a desire for self-improvement? Am I asking because I’m ashamed of something about my body? Do I consciously know I’m doing the right thing but lack the confidence to internalize that?

I realize this can be messy. If you’re new to fitness, often a question falls into both categories. If you do some reflection and realize that what you’re looking for is largely validation, though, a fitness subreddit may not always be the best place to get it. If this is where you are, I’d suggest trying a few things.

Start with the people close to you. Are you surrounded by people who demean or insult your body, or that you feel pity or condescend to you? Try discussing your struggles with them and see if you can set some boundaries around your body. If you can’t, you may not necessarily need to cut them out of your life, but it may also be time to build some new relationships with people who genuinely like and respect you. This probably sounds a bit glib, because it’s one of the most fundamentally difficult parts of growing up and of adulthood in general, but it’s also some of the most important work you’ll ever do. Working on self esteem is great, but self esteem doesn’t come exclusively from within, and you need people in your life who you can trust to be supportive.

If you have the resources, seek therapy. Again, probably sounds a bit dismissive and glib, but having a strategy for building yourself up emotionally is incredibly helpful, and a therapist who you trust is often the best qualified person to work on that plan with you.

If you’re a little shaky on both information *and* reassurance, and you have the resources, you might want to consider a strength and conditioning coach. You need to be careful in who you select, because the personal training industry can be predatory and feed on reinforcing your anxieties, but a good coach will both teach you how to train and help build your confidence in your ability to do so. For a beginner, a good coach’s job is about 10% providing information and guidance, and 90% reinforcing good habits and building your confidence.

As a final takeaway, just try to remember a few things: You don’t usually have to give up on your fitness goals in order to be kind to yourself and accepting of your current body. Bodies are resilient and adaptable. It’s ok to try something that you’re unsure of and fail. Injuries don’t happen all the time, but they do eventually happen to almost everyone, even people who don’t train at all, and in almost all cases you will recover and adapt.

Anyways, I hope this helps."

2022-10-27 07:58:19,Not happy about progress after ~1 year of lifting,"Hi everyone! 

Like the title says, I feel somewhat lost and would really appreciate any help from you guys. To give some context, I started lifting in mid November, 2021 at the age of 23 (Height - 5'9"", 175cm). Before that, I used to do little to no physical activity, played no sports, used to sit in front of computer for \~10hrs a day. I decided to work on my physique and joined the gym. Here's what I used to look like after a month of joining gym - [https://imgur.com/a/ovCvcuq](https://imgur.com/a/ovCvcuq). Skinny fat, \~70Kg (154lbs).

I had little to no muscle with belly fat, was weak, and so and I decided to bulk for 6 months. I increased my body weight by 10Kg over the period of 6 months, trained hard, did progressive overload (I was following [Reddit PPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/), training 6 days a week) and here's what I looked like at the end of June, 2022 - [https://imgur.com/a/52JwTAs](https://imgur.com/a/52JwTAs). 

Starting July 2022, I decided to cut and it's been 4 months and I've cut down to 68Kg (150lbs) and here's what I look right now as of end October, 2022 - [https://imgur.com/a/RkGcmHW](https://imgur.com/a/RkGcmHW)

Since we're done with the context, I'll come back to my point. Looking at my current physique is making me a little disappointed sometimes. I thought I did everything right and optimised everything - I tracked my calories, got enough protein (\~0.8-1g/lb of body weight daily), trained hard, tracked my workouts, implemented progressive overload but now I feel like the end result is not what I thought I would achieve in a year. My goal was to get more muscular, look better but I feel like I look almost the same from where I started, just marginally better. I watched a lot of youtube transformations and saw people achieving significant physique gains in just a year. I'm not saying they became greek god in a year but I can look at their before and after pictures and can appreciate the gains, I'm just not able to do the same for myself which is making me sad. Now I'm not being restless here, I'm willing to give it more time and effort as I have fallen in love with lifting and getting stronger. I just want to know if I'm on the right track or not. 

When I look back at the strength gains, I feel great at what I've achieved. I wasn't able to bench even the bar when I started and now I can bench more than my body weight. Talking about squats and deadlifts, I can squat 1.5x my bodyweight and deadlift 2x my bodyweight. From not being able to do a single pull-up, I can do 10 pull-ups in a row. Following my program, I include both heavy weight, low reps (3-5 reps) and low weight high reps (8-12 reps). It's just that I'm not proud of the muscle gains I have had, if I have gained any.

To summarise, I would like your thoughts on the following questions-

1. How would you rate my before - after pics? (poor/average/good). Am I being too harsh on myself? Am I expecting too much?
2. I'm currently at 68Kg (150lbs), 4 months into my cut and earlier I thought of cutting till I get visible abs. I still don't have visible abs, and some belly fat is still there. What should I do? Should I continue cutting? I'm afraid I'll end up looking more skinny.
3. After ending this cut, I'm planning to go on a lean bulk for the next whole year. Planning to gain \~1Kg/month. Is this fine or should I do it differently?

Hope you have all been well! Its been a year since my last post here and this last year has been a big one for my fitness journey! I finally decided to step out of my comfort zone and commit to a bodybuilding show after 7-8 years of training! I thought I'd do a write up of my experiences with bodybuilding as a whole and the preparation leading up to it as well as what my lifting journey has been like so far!

[2015-2022 Photo Dump](https://imgur.com/a/CIxIreF)

**WEIGHT:**

Started at 68KG/149lb and bulked up to as high as 88KG/194lb over 5 years of lifting (slow bulk with a few cuts in between). For some reason I don't have any photos of me at 88KG (lol). I then cut down slowly to about 83kg/183lb where I comfortably sit before starting a contest prep in 2021. During this prep I got as low as 75KG/165lb however didn't end up doing a the show because we were in COVID lockdown. Yo-yo dieted after this between 77kg/170lb and 82kg/181lb before starting another contest prep in June 2022 where I got as low as 72.8KG/160lb. 

72.8KG/160lb is a water depleted and carb depleted weigh in so It is a bit skewed but I was around that weight at my leanest. 

Timeframe is approximately 7.5+ years of progressive overload and eating at a surplus with a few cuts and breaks from weight training when I was travelling/busy with university. 

**BODYBUILDING:**

As per my previous post, I needed more motivation and was sick of going to the gym and just doing the movements and my body was slowly feeling the aches of lifting heavy for long periods of time. After trying to do the bodybuilding prep in 2021, I enjoyed the training style a lot and the progress I made so I decided I would definitely commit to a show in 2022. I started my 2022 prep in June and finished middle of October. I competed in 2 shows here in the New Zealand IFBB federation (Yes I am aware there are better federations for naturals but over here the NZIFBB is definitely the biggest federation and where most of my friends compete). The first show was a regional show where I placed first in my Mens Physique Novice Class, Second in my open class and Top 4 Overall. The second show is a Natural Nationals show where I placed First in my open class and Top 3 Overall! I am extremely happy with these results especially for my first bodybuilding season and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole process and have fallen in love with the intricacies of the sport. I didn't know anything about water manipulation, sodium manipulation, carb loading etc before this prep and it was extremely interesting to see the effects of these tools to enhance someone's physique in the short term. 

I do want to mention that getting extremely lean and maintaining is extremely difficult and you do honestly feel really terrible most of the time. Workouts get super crappy and you feel lethargic most of the day. I also had weird aches that prevented me from falling asleep as well as random headaches and dizziness. My partner would also say that I was extremely hangry and would snap at the stupidest things but I think I was okay :). 

**LIFT PROGRESS SUMMARY**

These numbers haven't much at all since my last write up as the focus has not been on these movements and instead on bodybuilding and hypertrophy training. I say this because during my competition prep and once I started to get leaner and leaner, I found that these big compound movements were extremely taxing and when I did try to include them, I would feel completely shattered (especially after Squats and Deadlifts) and wouldn't be able to put much into my accessory movements and get the training volume and stimulus that I wanted to train with.  

Please also note that most of these numbers were achieved at a bodyweight of around 183lb (83kg) to 187lb (85kg) and does not reflect my strength when cut down.

**Deadlift (Conventional):** 135lb (60kg) to 600lb (272.5kg)

**Deadlift (Sumo):** 135lb (60kg) to 645lb (292.5kg)

**Bench:** 88lb (40kg) to 353lb (160kg)

**OHP:** 45lb (20kg) to 243lb (110kg)

**Squat:** 135lb (60kg) to 474lb (215kg)

Videos of these lifts can be found on my Instagram.

**PROGRAM**

Training changed quite a lot from what I previous do. I have a wrist injury that I am dealing with at the moment (cyst in the wrist which likely requires surgery) so I removed OHP and Flat Benching from the training. Squats and Deadlifts were also removed about half way into my prep and I realized that previously I had been doing a lot of extra volume that wasn't that necessary (fluff volume). I aimed for two exercises per muscle group per day I was training it usually at 4 sets so a total of 16 total sets per muscle group a week (excluding legs) My split was primarily Push Pull Leg Rest Push Pull Rest. Below is an example workout of the exercises I selected. Just as a note, I wouldn't copy this to a tee because I've adapted this to what I think are my weaknesses etc. 

**Monday - Push 01 Chest Focus**

* 4x8-12 Incline Smith Machine Push
* 4x8-12 Incline Cable Chest Flies
* 4x8-12 Cable Chest Press
* 4x12-15 Chest Supported Cable Lateral Raises
* 4x12-15 Cable Rear Delt Flies
* 4x12-15 Crossover Cable Tricep Pushdowns
* 4x12-15 Crossover Cable Tricep Extensions

**Tuesday - Pull 01**

* 4x8-12 Single Arm Lat Bias Cable Pull Down
* 4x8-12 Single Arm Lat Bias Row
* 4x12-15 Chest Supported Dumbbell Row
* 4x12-15 Incline Bicep Curl
* 4x12-15 Single Arm Hammer Curls
* 3x12 Hanging Leg Raises (Toe to Bar)
* 3x12 Weighted Decline Sit Ups (Weight behind head)

**Wednesday - Leg 01**

Example workout would be

* 4x6-10 Hack Squats
* 4x8-12 Seated Leg Curls
* 4x8-12 Leg Extensions
* 4x12-15 Lying Hamstring Curls
* 4x12-15 Seated Calf Raises

**Thursday - Rest**

**Friday - Push 02 - Shoulder Focused**

* 4x12-15 Seated Lateral Raise
* 4x12-15 Cable Rear Delt Flies
* 4x12-15 Chest Supported Cable Lateral Raises
* 4x12-15 Crossover Cable Tricep Pushdowns
* 4x12-15 Crossover Cable Tricep Extensions
* 3x12 Hanging Leg Raises (Toe to Bar)
* 3x12 Weighted Decline Sit Ups (Weight behind head)

**Saturday - Pull 02**

Example workout would be

* 4x6-10 - Romanian/Stiff Leg Deadlifts
* 4x8-12 Single Arm Lat Bias Cable Pull Down
* 4x8-12 Upper Back Bias Row
* 4x8-12 Upper Back Focused Pull Down
* 4x8-12 Preacher Curls
* 4x8-12 Incline Bicep Curls

**Sunday - Rest**

It is worthy to note that I was doing cardio (Incline Treadmill Walking) basically 4 weeks into prep. It started off as 20 minutes a day and then progressed slowly and got to one hour per day at the tail end of prep. 

**DIET**

Diet on competition prep was pretty strict, I tracked my macros religiously with almost no days off for months at a time because I had holiday trips planned where I wanted to enjoy myself so I made sure to stay on track the rest of the time to be able to eat whatever when on holiday. My calories ranged from around 3000 calories at the start of prep down to 1800 calories at the lowest point of prep. On average I sat at around 2200-2500 calories for most of the time though. Below is an example of the foods I would eat. 

**Meal 01**

A mixture of Egg whites, Whole eggs, Protein Pancakes, Cereal, Milk, Toast, Peanut Butter, Protein Oats, and Fruit. Most of the time it would be a egg white + one whole egg omelet on toast with ketchup. 

**Meal 02**

150-200g cooked chicken breast

200g Sweet Potato

100g frozen beans or brocolli

**Meal 03**

150-200g cooked Low Fat Beef Mince

150g White Rice

100g frozen beans or brocolli

60-80g protein oats or something carby

**Meal 04 - Pre Gym**

150g Greek yogurt

100g Frozen Blue berries

**Meal 05 - Post Gym**

200g Rump Steak

400g Low Carb Potato or 200g Sweet Potato

100g Frozen Beans or Brocolli

Protein Shake with Water

Usually this adds up to about 2000-2400 calories depending on the day.

I have a wrist injury that I am dealing with at the moment (cyst in the wrist which likely requires surgery) so I removed OHP and Flat Benching from the training. Squats and Deadlifts were also removed about half way into my prep and I realized that previously I had been doing a lot of extra volume that wasn't that necessary (fluff volume). I aimed for two exercises per muscle group per day I was training it usually at 4 sets so a total of 16 total sets per muscle group a week (excluding legs) My split was primarily Push Pull Leg Rest Push Pull Rest. Below is an example workout of the exercises I selected. Just as a note, I wouldn't copy this to a tee because I've adapted this to what I think are my weaknesses etc. 

**Monday - Push 01 Chest Focus**

* 4x8-12 Incline Smith Machine Push
* 4x8-12 Incline Cable Chest Flies
* 4x8-12 Cable Chest Press
* 4x12-15 Chest Supported Cable Lateral Raises
* 4x12-15 Cable Rear Delt Flies
* 4x12-15 Crossover Cable Tricep Pushdowns
* 4x12-15 Crossover Cable Tricep Extensions

**Tuesday - Pull 01**

* 4x8-12 Single Arm Lat Bias Cable Pull Down
* 4x8-12 Single Arm Lat Bias Row
* 4x12-15 Chest Supported Dumbbell Row
* 4x12-15 Incline Bicep Curl
* 4x12-15 Single Arm Hammer Curls
* 3x12 Hanging Leg Raises (Toe to Bar)
* 3x12 Weighted Decline Sit Ups (Weight behind head)

**Wednesday - Leg 01**

Example workout would be

* 4x6-10 Hack Squats
* 4x8-12 Seated Leg Curls
* 4x8-12 Leg Extensions
* 4x12-15 Lying Hamstring Curls

* 4x12-15 Chest Supported Cable Lateral Raises
* 4x12-15 Crossover Cable Tricep Pushdowns
* 4x12-15 Crossover Cable Tricep Extensions
* 3x12 Hanging Leg Raises (Toe to Bar)
* 3x12 Weighted Decline Sit Ups (Weight behind head)

**Saturday - Pull 02**

Example workout would be

* 4x6-10 - Romanian/Stiff Leg Deadlifts
* 4x8-12 Single Arm Lat Bias Cable Pull Down
* 4x8-12 Upper Back Bias Row
* 4x8-12 Upper Back Focused Pull Down
* 4x8-12 Preacher Curls
* 4x8-12 Incline Bicep Curls

**Sunday - Rest**

It is worthy to note that I was doing cardio (Incline Treadmill Walking) basically 4 weeks into prep. It started off as 20 minutes a day and then progressed slowly and got to one hour per day at the tail end of prep. 

**DIET**

Diet on competition prep was pretty strict, I tracked my macros religiously with almost no days off for months at a time because I had holiday trips planned where I wanted to enjoy myself so I made sure to stay on track the rest of the time to be able to eat whatever when on holiday. My calories ranged from around 3000 calories at the start of prep down to 1800 calories at the lowest point of prep. On average I sat at around 2200-2500 calories for most of the time though. Below is an example of the foods I would eat. 

**Meal 01**

A mixture of Egg whites, Whole eggs, Protein Pancakes, Cereal, Milk, Toast, Peanut Butter, Protein Oats, and Fruit. Most of the time it would be a egg white + one whole egg omelet on toast with ketchup. 

**Meal 02**

150-200g cooked chicken breast

200g Sweet Potato

100g frozen beans or brocolli

**Meal 03**

150-200g cooked Low Fat Beef Mince

150g White Rice

100g frozen beans or brocolli

60-80g protein oats or something carby

**Meal 04 - Pre Gym**

150g Greek yogurt

100g Frozen Blue berries

**Meal 05 - Post Gym**

200g Rump Steak

400g Low Carb Potato or 200g Sweet Potato

100g Frozen Beans or Brocolli

Protein Shake with Water

Usually this adds up to about 2000-2400 calories depending on the day.

My youngest daughter kind of wants to get healthier, we have limited her computer time and are using it a carrot on a stick. She has taken a passing interest in running and boxing. which I'm more than happy to support. I know what works for me as a 39 year old wont work for her and what works for her sisters wont work for her.

I guess my question is as follows.

1) How can I approach this in a way that doesn't make her hate exercise, but appreciate it?

2) How much activity is too much activity for a 9 year old?

I grew up dirt poor. Im talking 1 meal every couple of days so I make sure she eats 3 meals a day and snacks often as she wants. ( i don't get upset if she doesn't clear her plate) I'm concerned about her relationship with food I know I struggle and I don't want that for her. So I'm approaching it with kid gloves and not judging her. I dont want to cut out sweet treats for her but I know north American diets for kids aren't always healthy. (I am not looking for calories deficit recommendations: I was told this my several actual medical professionals to NOT go into caloric deficit, that advice is not good advice in this situation and I know you mean well)

3) How can I approach healthy life style eating at this age without giving her a complex? I eat healthy, and I make healthy meals. good ingredients, proteins, game meat, standard.

4) Are there activities I should avoid, such as MMA or running?

5) what should I absolutely NOT do?

I love this little girl so much, I dont want her to think she isnt good enough as she is, but I do have an obligation to set her up with goals and hobbies and habits that encourage her to live a healthy life. Thank you

2022-10-22 19:23:48,No Rest Days,"I have surpassed 1,300 consecutive workouts. That's exercising every day without missing a day for over 3.5 years. Because I have seen such good results, ranging from muscle and strength development to quality-of-life improvements, I suggest you do the same.

While some may argue that such an approach is not optimal, their opinion is founded upon a misconception of recovery. That misconception is that being out of the gym and not doing any physical activity is the best way to recover from a workout. That's not true. If you're exercising three or four hours a week, congratulations, you're barely exceeding the [CDC's recommended minimum.](https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/adults/index.htm)

The idea that no gym = better recovery needs to die. I am happy to do the killing. Happier still that other people, since I started training without rest days, have started doing the same. Good recovery depends on your work capacity and your habits; sleep, diet, hydration, destressing - those kinds of things. Now, when it comes to work capacity, your training should have some aspect of conditioning. Many new lifters are simply not doing this, which is why I write this post, and put more detail in [this one.](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2022/10/1300-days-process-is-goal.html)

If you have a solid foundation of conditioning, meaning faster pace, higher rep exercises, as well as a decent amount of cardiovascular exercise (like running, hiking, swimming, etc.) then your harder training sessions will be completed more easily and take less out of you. You'll recover better because you are in better shape.

An easy way to get more conditioning in is to... you guessed it... train every day.

Now, I'm not saying you need to go to failure every day. Or that every workout needs to be an hour long and hit every body part oPtImAlLy. All I am saying is that out of the 168 hours each week, you can surely find five to seven hours to get a workout in. By doing so, you can begin the process of incrementally developing your conditioning in such a way that you will gradually begin seeing the benefits of including frequent and demanding conditioning workouts. Perhaps that's lower body fat, or not getting winded going up stairs, or being able to play with your kids longer... who knows.

What I do know, is that more conditioning has improved my strength, physique, and overall fitness. Not only mine, but those who I train, and who follow my training. I am not a special case. You can do what I have done.

**If you are unsure how to get started down the path of no-rest-days, here are some ideas from the above linked blog:**

**1.  Very unfit?** Start with one set of a bodyweight or isolation exercise on your rest days. Complete the work as quickly as possible. Squats, push-ups, sit-ups, curls, etcetera. Do ten reps. If you cannot do ten reps, then do as many as you are able. If that’s five reps, no problem. You must start somewhere. Add a set each week for four weeks, trying to make each ten reps or so. Rest as little as able. Congratulations. You are now doing four sets of ten reps on your former rest days.

On the fifth week, do two exercises, each for one set. Again adding a set to both for four weeks. That would be two months of “no rest days.” Granted, not a whole lot of work on these training days, but at least you are doing something and working towards doing more. The second month ends with two exercises each performed for 4x10. Completed with as little rest between sets as possible.

On the ninth week, the start of the third month, add a third exercise and again repeat the process of adding a set for four weeks. Week twelve ends with three exercises completed for 4x10 for a total of 120 reps (completed as quickly as you can). In these three months you will go from one set on one exercise to four sets on three exercises in a single workout that would otherwise be a day spent lounging around (which is misunderstood as recovery). For each former rest day, do different movements. Develop variety.

For those who are just starting out, this process of gradual development is sustainable and easy to recover from. In fact, doing more will improve your work capacity faster, which means that your recovery ability in general will improve. A small workout when feeling sore is better medicine than a pity party.

**2.  Trained but have a small engine?** Try the above development process, and/or try working against the clock on those days where you’re not weight training. Start with a five-minute workout for as many rounds as possible with two exercises doing ten reps each. Then, on a separate rest day, turn it into a training day by doing five rounds as fast as possible with two different exercises, each for ten reps.

In these two workouts, you have one where you are working with fixed time (the 5-minute AMRAP) and fixed work (five rounds as fast as possible). The variables are volume in the former and time in the latter. This matters because for some one or the other will be more motivating. Additionally, to each you will add more work in a different way every week.

For the fixed time workout, add one minute each week. That turns into eight minutes at the end of the first month. Eight minutes, as fast as possible, of two exercises for ten reps each is tough. Maybe it is just squats and push-ups. Sounds easy? Wrong. Have fun doing it. For the fixed work session, keep those same five rounds but add two reps per exercise. The fourth week is then five rounds of two exercises performed for 16 reps each (Wk1: 10 reps, Wk2: 12 reps, Wk3: 14 reps, Wk4: 16 reps).

For both workouts you will likely find yourself getting more reps done per minute. That is an increase in training density, a function of developing your work capacity. Once you grow bored with this progression, or these exercises, change the movements being performed or change the progression by starting with more time, rounds, or reps per set.

A third option is to have a fixed amount of work, perhaps five sets of ten reps on two exercises (so 100 reps total). Perform them as fast as possible the first week. Then, for the next three weeks, try shaving off time from that same amount of work. This keeps the movement, load, and volume the same but by doing it in less time you are again improving training density. Shaving off one second from the week prior is progress.

These three options are great for those who are already training and for those new lifters who feel up to the challenge. I don’t want it to seem too difficult. These are demanding workout progressions but are easily individualized by working at your own pace and choosing exercises you are already confident with. It doesn’t have to be squats and deadlifts. It could be as simple as push-ups (elevating your hands if needed) and leg lifts, or triceps extensions and biceps curls, or dips and pull-ups. Most people already lifting weights are on a three- or four-day training program, thus, these three options can replace “rest days” and make them productive training sessions.

**3.  Experienced but want to do more and not sure how?** Take any of the options above, scale it up by adding a bit more time, another exercise, or a few more sets, more weight – you get the idea. Just be sensible. Start small and scale your way up the same way a novice would. You would just start with a greater initial demand.

Another option for lifters of this caliber is to do an every minute on the minute (EMOM) workout with a compound lift of your choosing and one or two other accessory exercises. For example: Deadlifts and push-ups. Starting with just ten minutes, add a minute or two each week. Over the course of four weeks this can grow to 16 minutes or more, depending on the development of the lifter.

For EMOM workouts, to make them easier, do fewer reps per set, thereby allowing for more rest before that next minute. To make them harder, do more reps per set, which will have the opposite effect because it will take longer, meaning less rest each minute. Likewise for doing more exercises each round. The more you do every minute, the less rest you get before the next minute starts, and you again must begin repping out the weight.

What I like about EMOM’s for more experienced lifters (meaning those who are confident with their technique; not necessarily having achieved an earthshattering deadlift, for example) is that it allows for more reps to get done with a foundational movement, such as squat, bench, deadlift, etc., while also serving as conditioning. Now, this could be done with the above options, but with EMOM workouts you are afforded a rest period. Something that benefits those major barbell lifts because they can take 10 to 30 seconds to set up for.

An EMOM I recently completed was the trap bar deadlift paired with push-ups. Each performed for five reps, for 60-minutes. That totaled 300 reps, setting me up for success come the 1,300th workout described at the opening of this post. I didn’t start with 60-minute EMOM workouts, but I gradually got myself there. Doing so meant that I stopped being sore after that much work, and, in fact, I could do even more work without demanding too much of my recovery – all because my work capacity has improved so significantly.

Lastly, you can try some of the ideas found [here](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2014/02/conditioning-barney-style-how-to-stay.html).

**4.  Other Options.** Try adding a session that trains muscles and/or movements that you know are underdeveloped. This would more closely resemble how the T3 accessory exercises are performed in my programs such as [Jacked & Tan 2.0](http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2016/07/jacked-tan-20.html), [UHF](http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2016/02/gzcl-applications-adaptations.html), and [General Gainz](https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/aqkdgo/happy_gday_gainerz/) formatted workouts (or however you currently treat those exercises). Perhaps you are on a body part or an upper lower split. This would allow you to do something like more direct arm work in a new session on that former rest day that comes before your “leg day.” You will then have 24-hours (or more) before your next upper body session, perhaps “chest day.”

Likewise, maybe your current training model has a movement split (rather than body parts; a “bench” day, “squat” day, etc.) or is a full-body session. In such cases you could do all those ab and back exercises you’ve been skipping. More of those is likely what you need to get that next deadlift PR anyways. Just start with a few sets and scale up, much like described above.

Maybe you’re already doing abs, arms, and shoulders as part of your exercise selection and feel it is well rounded. No problem. Do something like farmer’s walks, or other carries, sled drags, or step-ups instead. This is the classic “general physical preparedness” training that was once advocated by guys like Louie Simmons, and many others, but has since been eschewed by the new age hyper-specific optimalists that pollute the information sphere with the tired lies that minimizing your training will maximize your results.

**But is it Optimal?**

Shut. Up.

For most, more training is optimal, not less. If you are dissatisfied with your results, chances are you are not training enough, or eating, sleeping, destressing, and other similar means of actual recovery. So, try doing more of those things that require effort and consistency; things which simply not working out is not. Stressing over online gaming matches while surviving on Soylent and Bangs and sleeping five hours a night is not optimal. Try improving those habits before spending the next three weeks crafting a spreadsheet for the [optimal training program](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2014/10/the-perfect-powerlifting-program.html).

There is no “hack” to an impressive physique or physical ability. Wasting your time scouring the internet for such a one-weird-tricks is not optimal. Strength and conditioning, done frequently and with quality effort, in the traditional means I describe, is.

**Lastly**, if you have time to be on reddit, you have time to workout every day. Start with a single set and ramp your way up as described in the first recommendation.

That would be two months of “no rest days.” Granted, not a whole lot of work on these training days, but at least you are doing something and working towards doing more. The second month ends with two exercises each performed for 4x10. Completed with as little rest between sets as possible.

On the ninth week, the start of the third month, add a third exercise and again repeat the process of adding a set for four weeks. Week twelve ends with three exercises completed for 4x10 for a total of 120 reps (completed as quickly as you can). In these three months you will go from one set on one exercise to four sets on three exercises in a single workout that would otherwise be a day spent lounging around (which is misunderstood as recovery). For each former rest day, do different movements. Develop variety.

For those who are just starting out, this process of gradual development is sustainable and easy to recover from. In fact, doing more will improve your work capacity faster, which means that your recovery ability in general will improve. A small workout when feeling sore is better medicine than a pity party.

**2.  Trained but have a small engine?** Try the above development process, and/or try working against the clock on those days where you’re not weight training. Start with a five-minute workout for as many rounds as possible with two exercises doing ten reps each. Then, on a separate rest day, turn it into a training day by doing five rounds as fast as possible with two different exercises, each for ten reps.

In these two workouts, you have one where you are working with fixed time (the 5-minute AMRAP) and fixed work (five rounds as fast as possible). The variables are volume in the former and time in the latter. This matters because for some one or the other will be more motivating. Additionally, to each you will add more work in a different way every week.

For the fixed time workout, add one minute each week. That turns into eight minutes at the end of the first month. Eight minutes, as fast as possible, of two exercises for ten reps each is tough. Maybe it is just squats and push-ups. Sounds easy? Wrong. Have fun doing it. For the fixed work session, keep those same five rounds but add two reps per exercise. The fourth week is then five rounds of two exercises performed for 16 reps each (Wk1: 10 reps, Wk2: 12 reps, Wk3: 14 reps, Wk4: 16 reps).

For both workouts you will likely find yourself getting more reps done per minute. That is an increase in training density, a function of developing your work capacity. Once you grow bored with this progression, or these exercises, change the movements being performed or change the progression by starting with more time, rounds, or reps per set.

A third option is to have a fixed amount of work, perhaps five sets of ten reps on two exercises (so 100 reps total). Perform them as fast as possible the first week. Then, for the next three weeks, try shaving off time from that same amount of work. This keeps the movement, load, and volume the same but by doing it in less time you are again improving training density. Shaving off one second from the week prior is progress.

These three options are great for those who are already training and for those new lifters who feel up to the challenge. I don’t want it to seem too difficult. These are demanding workout progressions but are easily individualized by working at your own pace and choosing exercises you are already confident with. It doesn’t have to be squats and deadlifts. It could be as simple as push-ups (elevating your hands if needed) and leg lifts, or triceps extensions and biceps curls, or dips and pull-ups. Most people already lifting weights are on a three- or four-day training program, thus, these three options can replace “rest days” and make them productive training sessions.

**3.  Experienced but want to do more and not sure how?** Take any of the options above, scale it up by adding a bit more time, another exercise, or a few more sets, more weight – you get the idea. Just be sensible. Start small and scale your way up the same way a novice would. You would just start with a greater initial demand.

Another option for lifters of this caliber is to do an every minute on the minute (EMOM) workout with a compound lift of your choosing and one or two other accessory exercises. For example: Deadlifts and push-ups. Starting with just ten minutes, add a minute or two each week. Over the course of four weeks this can grow to 16 minutes or more, depending on the development of the lifter.

For EMOM workouts, to make them easier, do fewer reps per set, thereby allowing for more rest before that next minute. To make them harder, do more reps per set, which will have the opposite effect because it will take longer, meaning less rest each minute. Likewise for doing more exercises each round. The more you do every minute, the less rest you get before the next minute starts, and you again must begin repping out the weight.

What I like about EMOM’s for more experienced lifters (meaning those who are confident with their technique; not necessarily having achieved an earthshattering deadlift, for example) is that it allows for more reps to get done with a foundational movement, such as squat, bench, deadlift, etc., while also serving as conditioning. Now, this could be done with the above options, but with EMOM workouts you are afforded a rest period. Something that benefits those major barbell lifts because they can take 10 to 30 seconds to set up for.

An EMOM I recently completed was the trap bar deadlift paired with push-ups. Each performed for five reps, for 60-minutes. That totaled 300 reps, setting me up for success come the 1,300th workout described at the opening of this post. I didn’t start with 60-minute EMOM workouts, but I gradually got myself there. Doing so meant that I stopped being sore after that much work, and, in fact, I could do even more work without demanding too much of my recovery – all because my work capacity has improved so significantly.

Lastly, you can try some of the ideas found [here](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2014/02/conditioning-barney-style-how-to-stay.html).

**4.  Other Options.** Try adding a session that trains muscles and/or movements that you know are underdeveloped. This would more closely resemble how the T3 accessory exercises are performed in my programs such as [Jacked & Tan 2.0](http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2016/07/jacked-tan-20.html), [UHF](http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2016/02/gzcl-applications-adaptations.html), and [General Gainz](https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/aqkdgo/happy_gday_gainerz/) formatted workouts (or however you currently treat those exercises). Perhaps you are on a body part or an upper lower split. This would allow you to do something like more direct arm work in a new session on that former rest day that comes before your “leg day.” You will then have 24-hours (or more) before your next upper body session, perhaps “chest day.”

Likewise, maybe your current training model has a movement split (rather than body parts; a “bench” day, “squat” day, etc.) or is a full-body session. In such cases you could do all those ab and back exercises you’ve been skipping. More of those is likely what you need to get that next deadlift PR anyways. Just start with a few sets and scale up, much like described above.

Maybe you’re already doing abs, arms, and shoulders as part of your exercise selection and feel it is well rounded. No problem. Do something like farmer’s walks, or other carries, sled drags, or step-ups instead. This is the classic “general physical preparedness” training that was once advocated by guys like Louie Simmons, and many others, but has since been eschewed by the new age hyper-specific optimalists that pollute the information sphere with the tired lies that minimizing your training will maximize your results.

**But is it Optimal?**

Shut. Up.

For most, more training is optimal, not less. If you are dissatisfied with your results, chances are you are not training enough, or eating, sleeping, destressing, and other similar means of actual recovery. So, try doing more of those things that require effort and consistency; things which simply not working out is not. Stressing over online gaming matches while surviving on Soylent and Bangs and sleeping five hours a night is not optimal. Try improving those habits before spending the next three weeks crafting a spreadsheet for the [optimal training program](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2014/10/the-perfect-powerlifting-program.html).

There is no “hack” to an impressive physique or physical ability. Wasting your time scouring the internet for such a one-weird-tricks is not optimal. Strength and conditioning, done frequently and with quality effort, in the traditional means I describe, is.

**Lastly**, if you have time to be on reddit, you have time to workout every day. Start with a single set and ramp your way up as described in the first recommendation.

2022-09-14 02:26:18,How to incorporate fitness plans for two varying age groups and fitness levels,"My daughter (6) is involved with gymnastics and is relatively fit for her age. I am generally aware of fitness basics at a beginner/intermediate level. I used to train for and race triathlons. I've also done some hypertrophy work in the past. I've been a lurker on this sub for a while and the wiki has always helped guide me.

The thing is, I'm severely out of practice and out of shape. I went through health issues that put a halt to any activity and I let my diet get out of control. My daughter is concerned and asked me to start working out. I asked if she wanted to be my fitness partner and she agreed.

My question is: 

Where do I start with a 6 year old in fitness? How do I figure out what is appropriate that will benefit both of our fitness levels? Should we do walk/runs? Body weight exercises? Yoga? I've re-read the wiki and looked online, but haven't found anything that really gave me a good idea of where to start when it comes to youth fitness.

I've been looking for something that starts slow. She gets discouraged when things start too quickly. I made the mistake of letting her try out for a competitive soccer league without knowing how fast they are out of the gate and she completely lost interest in soccer after that. I don't want that to happen with general fitness.

I'm hoping some of you fitness gurus have any insight for me.",Fitness,"How to incorporate fitness plans for two varying age groups and fitness levels-My daughter (6) is involved with gymnastics and is relatively fit for her age.

2022-09-12 06:04:16,Is weighted Ab training going to make me look fat?,"Hello my name is Ari and I have been training as body builder for a bit over year.

I know you need low body fat percentage to get your abs to really show. That being said I am a pretty low percentage according to the 3 site test, but even so my abs have very little definition. I started to do weighted Ab training in hopes that they will begin to pop, but now I am simply worried that my stomach and mid section will only end up looking thicker and less desirable. I try doing research on the subject but there is no definite answer. Many advocate for weighted Ab training saying it will make your abs look nicer at higher body fat percentages, while others say it will just push out the fat at higher percentages. I would like to maintain my V figure I am just worried that the weighted Ab training would ruin that for me, and I should stick to body weight like I have been doing.",Fitness,"Is weighted Ab training going to make me look fat?-Hello my name is Ari and I have been training as body builder for a bit over year.

Eric has PhD in exercise physiology with a focus on sports nutrition and supplementation, and Greg is a former record-holder in powerlifting who’s lost nearly 60 pounds in the past year since transitioning away from the sport. They have not only released a bundle of 28 free strength training programs to help meet fitness goals, but have also developed a premium nutrition tracking app (MacroFactor) to help really dial in your daily diet! You can find them at https://www.strongerbyscience.com/ and https://www.macrofactorapp.com, where you can browse their free resources, research library, and in-depth nutrition and exercise content to see the science behind building a healthy lifestyle! 

As many folks who have worked on managing their weight already know, gaining control over your diet can be the hardest step: learning how to log calories, wading through information about macros, and successfully implementing new choices/behaviors around food choices can be a real challenge. Stronger by Science is here in r/loseit to talk about their experiences with managing nutrition, and answer your questions about building a healthier lifestyle! So, get your questions ready for Eric and Greg, and prepare to ask them anything!

2022-08-25 17:14:59,Examine.com Updated Their Website,"In case you haven't seen it, [Examine.com](https://examine.com/) launched their new site. For those of that don't know, it's a website that had it's beginnings in this very community about a decade ago because the creators were tired of all the misinformation around nutrition and supplements in the fitness community. Since then they all haven't stopped working and have been expanding more and more, adding new supplements and all the relevant research at what seems like a weekly basis. It's basically a heavily researched/cited Supplements wiki.

They just came out with their new and possibly improved? website design, which is the first update in years. Looks like instead of just focusing on supplements they're also going to be expanding their horizons. Looks pretty cool.

As a healthcare provider I use the website somewhat regularly because my patients always have questions and while I try to be well read, it's impossible to keep up with everything by yourself. So I do a dive, and tell them what stuff their sketchy naturopath prescribed them is actually just a huge waste of money/cash grab, and what actually might help. I always of course always stress that healthy eating habits, exercise, adequate sleep, and reducing causes for stress are always the four pillars, but on top of that supplements can help for stuff, particularly in certain situations (living far enough north of the equator/working indoors during the day and Vitamin D supplementing, if you can't get enough protein from regular food, supplementing, if you can't get enough fiber from food, supplement, and so on). 

Linking directly to the actual studies has always been the biggest thing for me, because sometimes you want to just do the deep dive lit review. But I like the increasing information on the website as well for the times when I'm feeling lazy. I like how it looks quite a bit more streamlined/things are more integrated.

The book talks about the great mental health benefits of aerobic exercise and recommends building up to a daily active routine. I've fallen in love with running and would do so every morning if I built it up to the point a 30-minute jog is as casual as going out for a walk.

This got me to wonder, what are other things you could build up to that may start as actual workouts but could benefit you as a habit? I was thinking of experimenting with a daily failure set of push ups, squats, calf raises, band pull-aparts and/or some ab work and see where that ends up; the goal here is not a proper workout, but rather physical activity that keeps the machine running, I suppose, without taxing my recovery.

2022-08-22 17:50:21,DEXA scans and other inaccuracies,"Really good article from u/gnuckols today on body composition ""measurements,"" including DEXA. This is a subject that comes up here from time to time, so...

Here's the article: [https://macrofactorapp.com/body-composition/](https://macrofactorapp.com/body-composition/)

Some relevant quotes:

>The first thing to know is that there’s no way of *measuring* body composition in living, breathing humans. There is exactly one way to *measure* body composition: carefully dissecting a cadaver, and weighing each component of the cadaver after completing the dissection. That’s certainly a morbid fact to ponder, but it’s the bedrock of body composition assessment.  
>  
>If you’ve never been dissected – since you’re reading this article, I assume you haven’t – you’ve never had your body composition *measured*. You’ve only had your body composition *estimated*. Understanding this fact is important for two reasons. First, it invites a simple question: “what IS actually being measured in order to estimate body composition?” Second, it invites us to consider the validity and reliability of body composition estimates.

I was already familiar with the pitfalls of BIA scales (and other devices that use conductive pads on your hands or feet to estimate body fat %) but I never got a DEXA scan or even gave DEXA much thought, so I only had a vague sense that there is some inaccuracy but wasn't sure where it might come from. This was eye opening (emphasis mine):

>Due to the relatively expensive and high-tech nature of these scanners, people often assume that their body composition estimates are nearly perfect. However, there are some noteworthy limitations that are rarely acknowledged outside of academic journals. For example, DEXA scanners are unable to directly measure tissue thickness, so **they are forced to derive composition estimates of a 3-dimensional body from a 2-dimensional scan**. Further, the devices are only able to estimate soft tissue composition (i.e., the relative content of lean tissue and fat tissue) in pixels that contain no bone mass. For most scans, about 40% of the total pixels will contain bone, so **nearly half of the scan is essentially uninterpretable** (without assumption-driven calculations) for the purpose of body fat estimation.

We often assume that even if a method is a little bit off, it will still be consistent enough to help us measure changes over time. That's not always true, though. When it comes to BIA scales, I noticed that my scale never changes its estimate very much even when I've made significant changes to my body composition. Research bears this out; scales aren't very useful this way.

Here's how that may shake out with DEXA (this quote comes after a detailed example, worth clicking through and reading the whole thing):

>If DEXA says you lost 14kg of fat and 6kg of lean mass, that actually means you lost somewhere between 10-18kg of fat, and somewhere between 2-10kg of lean mass. In other words, DEXA is telling you that the outcome of your diet was somewhere between “unambiguously good” and “catastrophically bad.”

This doesn't mean scans are useless, but we should probably be taking them with a huge grain of salt - which may make some of us reconsider whether we want or need one.",Fitness,"DEXA scans and other inaccuracies-Really good article from u/gnuckols today on body composition ""measurements,"" including DEXA.

2022-08-18 01:08:36,Why do I struggle so much on single leg exercises and how can I improve my balance with them?,"So lately I’ve been wanting to start incorporating single leg exercises into my leg days because I want to work on my upper glutes. The problem is whatever I try (split squats and leg press) my balance is so off and/or I can barely do any weight. For example when I use the seated leg press, with both legs I am able to get to 110-130lbs but when I try to do a single leg one (with full range of motion) I can barely do 5 reps at 10lbs! I also tried split squats at a 6 in elevation just body weight and I just can’t seem to get myself back up, same with any variation of lunges. I’m not sure if it’s a balance thing or weight thing, I hip thrust 135 and rdl 88 regularly. What are ways I can improve my balance or any advice on what my issue may be? I’ve searched Reddit for the answer and couldn’t find anything (other than some very weird subs I did not know existed) and google just showed my HOW to do the exercises not why I’m unable to do them. I’ve been lifting for about 1.5 years now and any advice would be greatly appreciated:)",Fitness,"Why do I struggle so much on single leg exercises and how can I improve my balance with them?-So lately I’ve been wanting to start incorporating single leg exercises into my leg days because I want to work on my upper glutes.

2022-08-11 20:01:48,Improving athletic ability,"Hello all. I’m not sure to which community to ask this question to but this one looked relevant to me.

I’m a 31 year old guy and growing up I never took up any sports or athletics. 

I started playing table tennis when I was around 22 and I’m quite decent in it. I have taken up badminton as well recently and I’m okay in that too. I’m very poor in football but I have the stamina to run around for an hour of football(astro turf 7vs7). I can jog for 40 mins and my best is 5K in 28 mins.

Here is my problem, in table tennis, badminton, football or any sport I cannot generate the power I see others doing. They are quite bad at the sport and I can beat them(in table tennis and badminton) but the power they generate on some of the shots I can only dream of. I’m hitting with all my might but I can never get that acceleration and power. Even in football I cannot generate the power to kick the ball far. Guys who are thinner and weaker than me are generating that power effortlessly. 

I have taken up gym as well recently to improve my power and I have never been to gym ever in my life. But still I’m no good. What is it that I lack in general? What type of exercise should I take up to improve on this? 

What I have noticed is that i can generate the acceleration these other guys seems to produce. In all the above sports I read constantly that I should not tense up the body but no matter how loose I hold rackets or keep my legs loose I can never generate that power.

How do I train for that? Any ideas. Sorry for the long post.",Fitness,"Improving athletic ability-Hello all. I’m not sure to which community to ask this question to but this one looked relevant to me.

I’m a 31 year old guy and growing up I never took up any sports or athletics. 

I started playing table tennis when I was around 22 and I’m quite decent in it. I have taken up badminton as well recently and I’m okay in that too. I’m very poor in football but I have the stamina to run around for an hour of football(astro turf 7vs7). I can jog for 40 mins and my best is 5K in 28 mins.

Here is my problem, in table tennis, badminton, football or any sport I cannot generate the power I see others doing. They are quite bad at the sport and I can beat them(in table tennis and badminton) but the power they generate on some of the shots I can only dream of. I’m hitting with all my might but I can never get that acceleration and power. Even in football I cannot generate the power to kick the ball far. Guys who are thinner and weaker than me are generating that power effortlessly.

However, depression and anxiety disorders and other medical issues have resulted in me feeling so fatigued all the time that I gave up on high intensity exercise. The medical issues are gone now but the depression/anxiety is still there and I still feel fatigued.

Do you have experience of working through such situations? Have you trained anyone with such problems? I just want to know what type of stuff could be a safe way for me to test how much my body can handle. 

I have already tried daily walks up to 1hr 45mins (spread out) and it only had positive outcomes for me. Now that I am able to walk at least an hour daily, I want to test if I can get back to resistance training.

_________Example of What's in the Notes_________

**Quick Intro:**

These are 6 months worth of reading books, watching documentaries, listening to podcasts, and trying new methods of training all in my pursuit to be more fit.  That said, I've decided to share notes I've taken on the three coaches I consider to be the top teachers and doers of the strength, conditioning, and nutrition industry, whose pedigree spread across the experienced  trenches of Olympians, US Special Operations, World Strongest Man, UFC, NFL, etc --just to name a few. Now, they are by no means the holders of the gospel of fitness, nor are they the only voices worth listening to, but here's why I chose who I chose:

**Philosophy of Choice:**

* Achievements in personal fitness - need to be fit, and have fitness results in their own life. Can't be all head knowledge or studies. No book worms or science nerds without the in-the-trenches experience.
* Achievements in client fitness - need to have produced results in others lives, because knowing what works for you is vastly different than being able to identify, correct, and advance what works for others.
* Renown and respected by the community - peers need to recognize contributions to the community
* Longevity - How long have they been in the game? How long have they stayed healthy? How long have they been training clients? All important questions in establishing reputation.


**Why I Chose Stan Efferding:**

> To me, Stan is the summation of an average guy with absolute discipline who's taken the best advice from the best gurushe's personally trained with from around the world for decades, and becoming himself an absolute beast. I chose Stan because of his humble demeanor, and because he's also one of the strongest bodybuilders in the world. Additionally, he has trained the Mountain to win his first Arnolds Strongest Man 2018 this past March.

>* Blue collar guy who presents some info. No tips or tricks. Turned over every rock looking for the secret. Spent loads of money, and there is only one answer: sleep, eat, and train.
* Matt Wenning calls him ""the strongest bodybuilder on planet earth.""
* Helped get Hapthorr ""The Mountain"" diet in check, where he set records in elephant bar (1000lbs+) and bag-over-bar, and take first as Arnolds Strongest Man 2018.
* Coached various bikini competitors, NBA, NFL, MLB, UFC, etc
* Worked with Brian Shaw's diet and helped him achieve second place at Arnolds Strongest Man 2018.
* Coaching Larry Wheels (aesthetic and powerful beast) and Dan Green. 
* Has trained with almost every guru in the business, directly or indirectly.
* Former bodybuilding and powerlifting competitor. 
* Squats in the 800lbs+ at 50+ years of age.


**Why I Chose Charles Poliquin:**

> One of the first world renown and truly experienced strength coaches of the modern era. ""Research catches up to Charles,"" has been said about his bleeding edge yet common sense approach to training. While considered by a few to be the king of psuedo-science, the ironic part of this claim is that from all my note-taking from the past 6 months --from books on Green Berets to interviews with the Mountain to 3-hour long seminars with various teachers-- Charles cites his sources and explains the history of what he's talking about more often than any other individual or source I've been reading, watching, or listening.

> * One of the best and most distinguished strength coaches in the world.
* Trained various Special Operations (Seal Team 6, SAS included)
* Coached the US womens team to win their first Olympic gold in history, and defeated Japan in their 20 year reign.
* 38+ years of Olympian training across 23 different sports, went to 3 different Olympics as a coach. Also have trained various high-level professional athletes and coaches in the military, Crossfit, NFL, NHL, MLB, etc.
* Researches studies from as far back as 1890's
* Ability to recall information, facts, research papers, all to the date, location of study, and to the author/researcher, a skill second to no other fitness expert (reminds me of the level of expert recall Robert McNaramara displays in the documentary ""Fog of War"").
* Lectures around the world with book authors like Jay Papasanas, Ed Coan, and world renown athletes like Dmitry Klokov.
* Always ahead of the curve (attributed as first in the US to recommend BCAAs, fish oils, German Volume training,  tempo training, cluster training, neuro transmitter profile training, etc).
* Stan Efferding, Matt Wenning, and Mark Bell have all implemented information from Charles into their personal training, and how they train clients, and all speak highly of him.
* Has huge biceps and abs for an old man.

**Why I Chose Matt Wenning:**

> I chose Matt because of his personal and professional achievements. Hired to train various Special Operations for the military and is the first to be implemented at a large scale. His methods have reduced injury rates across the board for fire, police, and military (and thus saved money for those organizations), and is a master of training and preventing overtraining.

> * Multiple records in the squat alone, including a 1196lb squat.
* Broke 4 world records; second highest RAW at 208 class with 2204lb total.
* Works with thousands of US military, including various Ranger regiments, 4th Infantry, and paratroopers out of Bragg. 
* Developed Mountain Warrior Athlete program out of Ft. Carson.
* Clients include NFL, US Special Operations, law enforcement, fireman, professional athletes, universities, elderly (difficult to train and yield safe results) and kids with disabilities
* His training with first responders and military has reduced site budgets significantly, due to decreased injuries and insurance claims.
* Attended university in Indiana where NASA funded the strength and conditioning programs and recruited top-tier professors.
* Top ten in the world for almost two decades with no major injuries (rare in the strength industry)
* Masters degree in sports biomechanics under Dr. Kramer
* Trained closely and mentored by various powerlifting legends like Louie Simmons, Ed Coan from his teen years, and was one of the youngest to squat 900lbs

**Notes on Notetaking:**

> Each section of notes will include everything I felt was noteworthy, even if it's repeated 3 times in 3 other podcasts. I did this as people will cherry-pick which seminars they want notes on, and I don't want them to miss out on key information just because I wrote it down elsewhere. Also, rehearing the same things over and over again just works as positive reinforcement and mentally conditioning good habits. Can't hurt to hear solid advice over and over again.

> Additionally, these notes are taken as a stream-of-thought process and later revised and edited, so they may seem short, fluid, or lacking in information. I reread the notes a few times and tried to expand and clean up, but I will have missed some parts.

> **Compilation of Notes Regarding Training Women:** (work in progress)

> * For the female lifter: 10-minute walks better than 40 minute treadmill. Doesn't breakdown muscle, still helps with fat loss. 
* If on a limited calorie diet, then the caloric limit will yield results in body composition and performance based on the choice of foods, not just calorie choice. Choose nutrient rich foods like steak.
* 3oz of OJ or milk a couple times a day: liver and thyroid stimulus for metabolism. 
* Long cardio has high water demand. Sends wrong message to body: body holds on to fat to endure the longer workload. Also, body thinks heavy muscle is bad, gets rid of it.
* Stan noticed how joggers carry fat.  Body holds on to fat for fuel, gets rid of muscle. Body responds to stimulus you provide.
* Still need to develop cardio. Recommends HIIT under load: improves cardio while stimulating muscle. Weighted exercises with higher reps (why Matt and Stan recommend loaded exercise under distance). Performing 20 rep sets, or 30 second rest between weighted carries, running stairs (all concentric loading), pushing prowlers, 30s sprint/rest on recumbent bike (ten mins) are all great examples of cardio development.
* ""How do you talk people into losing weight by lifting weights?"" Cites his 60 year old women who lift weights and are lean. They don't have prior exercise experience, and they're stronger than most men.
* How much weight you have on you is 80% diet. Cardio isn't what gets bikini and stage competitors lean, it's they eat better. ""Don't want to be huge? Don't eat huge.""
* When you start training weights you start to retain water, so swelling occurs. Hypertrophy occurs, diet cleans up, everything will lean out.
* ""Foam rolling is a waste of time, and also leads to more scar tissue."" Evidence shows treadmill warmups insulin resistance by 46%. 
* Research: Sleep loss limits fat loss. Insulin resistance goes up; blood pressure goes up; hunger goes up; cortisol (breaks down muscle tissue; decreases testosterone, effects your thyroid; etc)
* Juicing and detox is completely worthless. All you can do is optimize how your body filtrates toxins, which is the liver. Best way to detox is to just not put the processed foods and oils into your body.
* 10 minute walks for athletes wanting to gain weight, with caloric gain. Also female competitors in bikini, but with calorie deficit. Helps digestion and insulin resistance. 
* Stan trained 40-50 minutes morning, 30 mins at night.
* Women tend to restrict and end of missing much needed fats and nutrients. Ability to absorb nutrients depends on using fats as a shuttle.
* ""*There's no black and white, there's only gray. Find out what fits you and do that*""
* States foam rolling is a waste of time, and also leads to more scar tissue. Evidence shows treadmill warmups insulin resistance by 46%. 
* If not yet deserving then stick to glutamine, amino acids, and whey. Losing body fat will make you more insulin sensitive.
* Steady-state cardio will cause you to get fatter. 
* Restricting fats causes fat. Fats help with insulin sensitivity.
* **Common mistakes with trainers and female clients:** not wanting to get strong. Not enough time on overload with women (don't have goals for strength). Short term goals to comply to regarding big lifts. Lean muscle tissue leads to insulin sensitivity.
* Believes most women in the gym are busy, not productive 
* Better glute development: split squats, squats, deadlifts (all of which develop horizontal and vertical jump). 



**TL;DR/Top Ten Changes I've Personally Made From These Lessons:**

There's a million bits of info in these notes, but here's some ten takeaways I was able to implement over the course of two months.

1. **Carbs:** Carbs are not the enemy, but need to be heavily regulated and based on individual performance, digestive health, and body-fat. Ethnic background is a huge factor. That being said, Charles states ""you need to earn your carbs,"" while Stan is more lenient, but still recommends you keep them low if you're not an elite athlete. If you do choose to eat carbs, white rice is the best carb as it doesn't cause inflammation or digestive issues like potatoes and brown rice can.
2. **Sleep:** The greatest anabolic, absolutely necessary. The elite performers sleep 10-12 hours a day, including long naps during the day. Important to muscle growth, fat loss, and hormone regulation. I dim the lights 2 hours before bed, do my best to not check my phone, tv, or any electronic screen to improve sleep quality. 
3. **Programming:** I've split my workouts with 72-hours between muscle groups. Using a variety of exercises helps overall performance by choosing accessory work that addresses weaknesses. ""Exercise rotation and having a big exercise library prevents injury while allowing constant key movements."" Only 4 main heavy days, with the other days as options for accessory or cardio.
4. **Food choice:** Grass-fed meat research isn't proven yet, and doesn't justify the price. Eat quality cuts of beef, bison, and wild game. ""Otherwise, the best diet is the one you stick to."" Just eliminated processed foods and snacks, and choose vegetables and fruits that the body will digest easily ([FodMap](https://www.ibsdiets.org/fodmap-diet/fodmap-food-list/)). Bought a sous-vide to prepare the Costco Steak, and a rice maker for the white rice. On it for two months and am seeing great results. Personally, I've added lots of berries, avocadoes, baby carrots, nuts, coconut oil, chia seeds to my daily diet. I also add kimchi and guacamole to some meals in order to keep the steak from being too routine. Also drinking 3oz of OJ multiple times a day.
5. **Warm-Up:** Static stretching isn't the best option prior to a lift, and cardio before your lift will cause you to be insulin resistant, preventing fat loss. Either do potentiation exercises, or follow this advice: ""brain should know the range of motion, and weights should get heavier."" Regarding potentiation: find where the weakest links are in the main lift, then pick a moderately light weight, and choose exercises that affect different muscle groups involved in the main lift. For example, the squat might be upper back (a), lower back (b), then hamstrings (c). Doesn't need to be heavy, just consistently volume with minimal rest. 4x25 with no rest: a, b,c, repeat 4 times total. Then rest 3-5 minutes, then you're ready attack the main lift (be if your heavy max or speed work). Matt noticed clients were getting stronger, and form was getting better over time. Matt started off light, but now can do 4x25's of 100lb dumbells on chest warmups. Work your way up. Here's the warm-up in practice with Mike O'Hearn, Stan, and Matt. 
6.  **Walking:** Not just for old people: Ten minute walk, after you eat a meal. Improves digestion, decreases DOMS, helps with insulin sensitivity. ""Blood is the life force, brings in all the nutrients."" Brisk walks with elevated heart outperforms leisure 10k step-walks in fat, heart, cardio benefits. Recommended is 3 ten-minute walks a day. Can replace all steady-state cardio with walks and HIIT. Recommended them to the women in competition and strongmen like the Mountain, both of whom saw fantastic results.
7. **Cardio:** Implemented rucks over distance running, along with adding swimming, cycling, and farmers carries. Long slow-distance work inhibits muscle growth *and* fat-loss. That said, some cardio is required, hence the HIIT, farmers walks, etc as they are recommended. Still learning to program into the workout regimen.
8. **Build the Backside:** If the muscle is behind you, chances are you need to build it stronger. The average person will have weak lower and upper back, hamstrings, glutes, calves, traps, rear delts, etc. Build those up by making them a priority in your accessory exercise selection. For example: Upperback not strong enough will change scapular position on bench press.
9. **Salt:** Upped the intake of my salt. Iodized salt, stimulates thyroid, immune system, stimulates the liver. When you hit a wall, it's because you're low on sodium, not carbs. Guaranteed. Single biggest thing you can do to impact performance, stamina and endurance at the gym is iodized sodium.
10. **Post-workout drink:**  Body super-compensates after a workout, so you need immediate replenishment, especially for two-a-days. Fructose (Orange juice) for liver stimulation, dextrose (scoop off Amazon) for glycogen replenishment, sodium (600mg), 100mg of caffeine (accelerates all of that). No proteins or fats immediately as it slows absorption.",Fitness,"Here's 70 pages of notes I've taken from 20+ podcasts/interviews/seminars from 3 leading strength and conditioning coaches: Stan Efferding, Matt Wenning, and Charles Poliquin.

**Notes on Notetaking:**

> Each section of notes will include everything I felt was noteworthy, even if it's repeated 3 times in 3 other podcasts. I did this as people will cherry-pick which seminars they want notes on, and I don't want them to miss out on key information just because I wrote it down elsewhere. Also, rehearing the same things over and over again just works as positive reinforcement and mentally conditioning good habits. Can't hurt to hear solid advice over and over again.

> Additionally, these notes are taken as a stream-of-thought process and later revised and edited, so they may seem short, fluid, or lacking in information. I reread the notes a few times and tried to expand and clean up, but I will have missed some parts.

> **Compilation of Notes Regarding Training Women:** (work in progress)

> * For the female lifter: 10-minute walks better than 40 minute treadmill. Doesn't breakdown muscle, still helps with fat loss. 
* If on a limited calorie diet, then the caloric limit will yield results in body composition and performance based on the choice of foods, not just calorie choice. Choose nutrient rich foods like steak.
* 3oz of OJ or milk a couple times a day: liver and thyroid stimulus for metabolism. 
* Long cardio has high water demand. Sends wrong message to body: body holds on to fat to endure the longer workload. Also, body thinks heavy muscle is bad, gets rid of it.
* Stan noticed how joggers carry fat.  Body holds on to fat for fuel, gets rid of muscle. Body responds to stimulus you provide.
* Still need to develop cardio. Recommends HIIT under load: improves cardio while stimulating muscle. Weighted exercises with higher reps (why Matt and Stan recommend loaded exercise under distance). Performing 20 rep sets, or 30 second rest between weighted carries, running stairs (all concentric loading), pushing prowlers, 30s sprint/rest on recumbent bike (ten mins) are all great examples of cardio development.
* ""How do you talk people into losing weight by lifting weights?"" Cites his 60 year old women who lift weights and are lean. They don't have prior exercise experience, and they're stronger than most men.
* How much weight you have on you is 80% diet. Cardio isn't what gets bikini and stage competitors lean, it's they eat better. ""Don't want to be huge? Don't eat huge.""
* When you start training weights you start to retain water, so swelling occurs. Hypertrophy occurs, diet cleans up, everything will lean out.
* ""Foam rolling is a waste of time, and also leads to more scar tissue."" Evidence shows treadmill warmups insulin resistance by 46%. 
* Research: Sleep loss limits fat loss. Insulin resistance goes up; blood pressure goes up; hunger goes up; cortisol (breaks down muscle tissue; decreases testosterone, effects your thyroid; etc)
* Juicing and detox is completely worthless. All you can do is optimize how your body filtrates toxins, which is the liver. Best way to detox is to just not put the processed foods and oils into your body.
* 10 minute walks for athletes wanting to gain weight, with caloric gain. Also female competitors in bikini, but with calorie deficit. Helps digestion and insulin resistance. 
* Stan trained 40-50 minutes morning, 30 mins at night.
* Women tend to restrict and end of missing much needed fats and nutrients. Ability to absorb nutrients depends on using fats as a shuttle.
* ""*There's no black and white, there's only gray. Find out what fits you and do that*""
* States foam rolling is a waste of time, and also leads to more scar tissue. Evidence shows treadmill warmups insulin resistance by 46%. 
* If not yet deserving then stick to glutamine, amino acids, and whey. Losing body fat will make you more insulin sensitive.
* Steady-state cardio will cause you to get fatter. 
* Restricting fats causes fat. Fats help with insulin sensitivity.
* **Common mistakes with trainers and female clients:** not wanting to get strong. Not enough time on overload with women (don't have goals for strength). Short term goals to comply to regarding big lifts. Lean muscle tissue leads to insulin sensitivity.
* Believes most women in the gym are busy, not productive 
* Better glute development: split squats, squats, deadlifts (all of which develop horizontal and vertical jump). 



**TL;DR/Top Ten Changes I've Personally Made From These Lessons:**

There's a million bits of info in these notes, but here's some ten takeaways I was able to implement over the course of two months.

1. **Carbs:** Carbs are not the enemy, but need to be heavily regulated and based on individual performance, digestive health, and body-fat. Ethnic background is a huge factor. That being said, Charles states ""you need to earn your carbs,"" while Stan is more lenient, but still recommends you keep them low if you're not an elite athlete. If you do choose to eat carbs, white rice is the best carb as it doesn't cause inflammation or digestive issues like potatoes and brown rice can.
2. **Sleep:** The greatest anabolic, absolutely necessary. The elite performers sleep 10-12 hours a day, including long naps during the day. Important to muscle growth, fat loss, and hormone regulation. I dim the lights 2 hours before bed, do my best to not check my phone, tv, or any electronic screen to improve sleep quality. 
3. **Programming:** I've split my workouts with 72-hours between muscle groups. Using a variety of exercises helps overall performance by choosing accessory work that addresses weaknesses. ""Exercise rotation and having a big exercise library prevents injury while allowing constant key movements."" Only 4 main heavy days, with the other days as options for accessory or cardio.
4. **Food choice:** Grass-fed meat research isn't proven yet, and doesn't justify the price. Eat quality cuts of beef, bison, and wild game. ""Otherwise, the best diet is the one you stick to."" Just eliminated processed foods and snacks, and choose vegetables and fruits that the body will digest easily ([FodMap](https://www.ibsdiets.org/fodmap-diet/fodmap-food-list/)). Bought a sous-vide to prepare the Costco Steak, and a rice maker for the white rice. On it for two months and am seeing great results. Personally, I've added lots of berries, avocadoes, baby carrots, nuts, coconut oil, chia seeds to my daily diet. I also add kimchi and guacamole to some meals in order to keep the steak from being too routine. Also drinking 3oz of OJ multiple times a day.
5. **Warm-Up:** Static stretching isn't the best option prior to a lift, and cardio before your lift will cause you to be insulin resistant, preventing fat loss. Either do potentiation exercises, or follow this advice: ""brain should know the range of motion, and weights should get heavier."" Regarding potentiation: find where the weakest links are in the main lift, then pick a moderately light weight, and choose exercises that affect different muscle groups involved in the main lift. For example, the squat might be upper back (a), lower back (b), then hamstrings (c). Doesn't need to be heavy, just consistently volume with minimal rest. 4x25 with no rest: a, b,c, repeat 4 times total. Then rest 3-5 minutes, then you're ready attack the main lift (be if your heavy max or speed work). Matt noticed clients were getting stronger, and form was getting better over time. Matt started off light, but now can do 4x25's of 100lb dumbells on chest warmups. Work your way up. Here's the warm-up in practice with Mike O'Hearn, Stan, and Matt. 
6.  **Walking:** Not just for old people: Ten minute walk, after you eat a meal. Improves digestion, decreases DOMS, helps with insulin sensitivity. ""Blood is the life force, brings in all the nutrients."" Brisk walks with elevated heart outperforms leisure 10k step-walks in fat, heart, cardio benefits. Recommended is 3 ten-minute walks a day. Can replace all steady-state cardio with walks and HIIT. Recommended them to the women in competition and strongmen like the Mountain, both of whom saw fantastic results.
7. **Cardio:** Implemented rucks over distance running, along with adding swimming, cycling, and farmers carries. Long slow-distance work inhibits muscle growth *and* fat-loss. That said, some cardio is required, hence the HIIT, farmers walks, etc as they are recommended. Still learning to program into the workout regimen.
8. **Build the Backside:** If the muscle is behind you, chances are you need to build it stronger. The average person will have weak lower and upper back, hamstrings, glutes, calves, traps, rear delts, etc. Build those up by making them a priority in your accessory exercise selection. For example: Upperback not strong enough will change scapular position on bench press.
9. **Salt:** Upped the intake of my salt. Iodized salt, stimulates thyroid, immune system, stimulates the liver. When you hit a wall, it's because you're low on sodium, not carbs. Guaranteed. Single biggest thing you can do to impact performance, stamina and endurance at the gym is iodized sodium.
10. **Post-workout drink:**  Body super-compensates after a workout, so you need immediate replenishment, especially for two-a-days. Fructose (Orange juice) for liver stimulation, dextrose (scoop off Amazon) for glycogen replenishment, sodium (600mg), 100mg of caffeine (accelerates all of that). No proteins or fats immediately as it slows absorption."

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.
2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and

Summary:

> Overall, this meta-analysis offers a perspective that may be really helpful for a variety of people in a variety of circumstances. For example, if a friend, family member, or potential client is interested in getting into resistance training, they may be concerned that they’ll need to live in the gym to reap notable benefits. However, you can tell them that they’ll likely reap most of the health benefits with just 30-60 minutes of resistance training per week, thus massively reducing the perceived barrier to starting. Similarly, plenty of serious lifters find it hard to keep up their desired training schedule due to changes in life circumstances (for example, starting a new job with punishing hours, or having kids). They may want to keep lifting for health reasons, but they aren’t sure if cutting their weekly training time from 4 hours to 1 hour will result in a resistance training dose that’s even worthwhile. Again, this meta-analysis suggests that just 30-60 minutes of resistance training per week is associated with a host of positive health and longevity outcomes, meaning that a considerable reduction in training volume will still result in a worthwhile and meaningful dose of training.

> Conversely, I suspect that most readers probably engage in resistance training for more than 130-140 minutes per week. This meta-analysis suggests that such a training dose may actually be associated with higher all-cause mortality risk, cardiovascular disease risk, and total cancer risk. So, how concerned should you be?

> I’d like to be able to say that you don’t need to be concerned at all (that would certainly fit my biases), but this isn’t the first time that such a relationship has been observed. 

Before we all panic and step away from our longer or more involved programs, some caveats:

> However, it’s also worth mentioning that the studies included in the present meta-analysis were all observational in nature. In other words, they tell us the relationships between resistance training dose and mortality/disease risk, but they can’t tell us that the resistance training dose causes the observed reductions and elevations in risk. 

> With all of that said, there’s one major reason to be skeptical that these results will generalize to all readers: the studies in this meta-analysis mostly used older subjects. It’s entirely possible that the optimal dose of resistance training for older adults is a lot lower than the optimal dose of resistance training for younger adults. For example, oxidative stress and generalized inflammation likely contribute to biological aging, and older adults have higher levels of oxidative stress and generalized inflammation.

2022-07-18 17:48:37,Is there an objective standard of physical prowess that everyone should aim to?,"I heard Peter Attia say that in his clinic, a 50 year old patient is asked to stay at the level equivalent to his own 40 year old at peak performance.

I believe they do mainly strength training (weight lifting), ""cardio"" (what he calls zone 2), and something resembling HIIT.

What left me wondering is: what is this ""peak performance"" he mentions? And what does it mean for me? As a 37 y.o., what physical feats should I be able to perform, even if I'm not an athlete? What are the things that everybody should be able to perform in some measure, and is there some kind of standard?

If somebody asked you: ""what physical things everybody should aim to be able to perform for as long as they live?"" (doesn't mean they can now, or at 70 or at 90, but that they should aim to)

So even if there is no consensus whatsoever, it would be interesting to simply know what is your answer to this

I'll write some completely random examples to give you an idea:

\- Deadlift your own body weight 3 sets 5 reps

\- Able to full squat (until your but touches the floor)

\- Run 5 km in 30 minutes

\- Bike 100 km within one day

\- Climbing a 5 meter tall tree

\- Walk from sunrise to sunset

\- Horse stance 15 minutes

\- Dive 20 meters deep

If you want to say, ""it depends on your goals"". Then assume the goal would be to maintain a great physical health through one's entire life, including very old age.

Edit: Lol, didn't expect so many comments. The examples above are completely random and non-sensical.

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.
2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and

Let's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.). This isn't a thread to announce what you find attractive in a mate. Please use the report function for any comments that are out of line.

So phittit, what's your physique pheel like this phriday?"

2022-07-07 15:36:23,How to convince myself to not overreach/overtrain?,"Hi All,

I don’t post much if ever but I’ve recently had an issue where, even though I do workout a lot, I’ve started feeling myself actually getting weaker.

I box as my main sport, at the very amateur level, and I had a pretty gnarly concussion in Feb that took me out. Before then I was in the best shape of my life, working out sometimes twice a day (strength in morning, boxing in evenings), doing proper recovery, and feeling great. I took nearly a month off after the concussion since I could barely walk the first two weeks. I was almost at the point where I feel like I’m near the same shape as before.

The issue is, especially in my legs, my body seems to tire and fatigue during intense workouts way easier than I remember - to the point where last week my coach noticed and questioned me on it. 

I’m thinking I need to potentially take more recovery and slow down, but honestly I hate doing that. I like exercising hard, pushing myself, and I feel like shit when I don’t. To others that had a similar situation where they need to lay off the gas - what did y’all do to convince yourself it was ok? 

TL;DR : How do you work out less to emphasize recovery without feeling lazy?",Fitness,"How to convince myself to not overreach/overtrain?-Hi All,
