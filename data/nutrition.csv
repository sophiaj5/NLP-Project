2023-10-15 01:09:39,Can someone explain the logic behind low-card diet to me?,"My biology knowledge mostly comes from my high school education, and what I've been told was that carbs are the main energy source, fat is the energy source for storage, and protein is the last source if the first two are not available. To have a balanced meal, you're supposed to get mostly carbs, lots of protein to build up your body, and not too much fat. And then I ignored health-related topics for years because I was young and healthy. Now I'm a little older I'm trying to figure out a more balanced diet, after a little digging around it seems the only diet you should have is low-carb diet, and rice and bread all of a sudden become the source of all evil.

From my understanding, low-carb diets try to cut down the carb intake so the body starts to use more fat for energy, so fat will become the main energy source, and then you will need to eat a bunch of fat to get full. The idea of fat as the main energy source sounds so wrong to me, isn't fat strongly correlated with heart problems? And if we don't eat rice and bread what should be the main food in a meal? A giant piece of butter? I'm also aware people are trying to make a distinction between whole grain and processed sugar for carbohydrates, the reasoning seems to be that whole grain contains extra nutrients that processed sugar doesn't have, but without the extra nutrient, aren't the carbs part of whole grain equally bad? Then why do we tolerate brown rice instead of white rice if we're still getting the same amount of glucose? It all feels very inconsistent.

I'm also not very sure if the low-carb diet is only targeted to people who need to lose weight or people in general because after reading multiple articles and watching youtube videos, it seems these types of diet give you every single benefit you can imagine and you will magically be healthy by switching to it. I'm underweight and I'm actually trying to be fatter, does a low-carb diet still make sense for me?

Overall I think what bothers me the most is the fact that low-carb diet completely contradicts what I learned about nutrition in the past, but it's so prominent and it's been advertised everywhere. It was a weird experience as if it's either everyone is crazy or I'm crazy. Is low-carb diet a new consensus in this field or I was just taught with outdated knowledge?

They do sell frozen broccoli everywhere which you can just throw in a pan/steam or put in the oven for a couple of minutes.
  
Would broccoli (or something else, like frozen spinach) pretty much give you all the stuff thats in green salads/lettuce?

1. Many people have vitamin deficiencies which can lead to illnesses.

2. Multivitamins provide a blanket amount of important vitamins for those who are lacking.

2023-10-10 19:22:53,Why don’t I hear more about leptin?,"I am not a nutritionist, but my understanding is that leptin is the hormone that our bodyfat directly produces in order to manage satiety.  The more fat we have, the more leptin is produced, the less hungry we get and the more quickly we shed fat.  It’s literally our body’s fat control lever.

The core issue would thus seem to be how sensitive we are to the leptin our bodies produce.  The more leptin we require before we turn off the hunger switch then the more resistant we are to it and the more fat we’ll have on our bodies.  This jibes directly with the controversial “bodyweight set point” concept and why we all yoyo when we diet.  Our leptin system ultimately wins the battle every time unless steps were taken during the diet to fix it.

So if the above is true (and again, I’m not a nutritionist so my perusing through wikipedia and so forth may be leading to incorrect conclusions — there’s no dogma here and I’m happy to be corrected), then shouldn’t our focus be on how we become more leptin sensitive?  Isn’t literally every approach to longterm weight loss futile if it’s a losing battle against leptin?  Why would I want to cut 30 pounds if my leptin all but guarantees that I gain it back?  It’s the same reason why some people can struggle to put on 20 pounds and then show off how quickly they can lose it by eating nothing but twinkies.  Their natural leptin sensitivity makes this easy for them.

Obviously some fat people do keep their weight off (although this is the exception rather than the rule) it seems to me that they must have done so by inadvertently fixing their leptin sensitivity, probably by eating certain foods or eating less of certain other foods.  Calorie input over time becomes lower, but less due to conscious effort.

I know there are some studies out there about how different diets and fitness routines affect leptin sensitivity, but why aren’t there more such studies and why does the focus seem to rarely on this hormone that’s *literally produced by our bodies to manage fat*?",nutrition,"Why don’t I hear more about leptin?-I am not a nutritionist, but my understanding is that leptin is the hormone that our bodyfat directly produces in order to manage satiety.

2023-10-06 00:59:04,"Newbie Question: How do you meet you calorie goal to gain lean muscle mass, while also trying to eat plant based and whole foods which tend to have low calories(Calorie Paradox) ?","
Hey guys,

It seems in order to gain lean muscle mass you need to consume lots of calories and then exercise. However, this is easier said than done. 

For instance, Orange Juice has 110 calories(mainly due to sugars). I’m talking about non-gmo orange juice..etc. We’ll assume it’s the healthiest orange juice you can buy at the store. In theory this is all great and you can gain the calories you need and then exercise. 

However, the problem is a lot of “health conscious” people are against foods like orange juice. The people offline and online who mostly advocate for  plant based diet,  whole foods with the occasionally fish and dairy people. 

 Many health conscious people will tell you orange juice is basically water with sugar..etc. You need to eat whole fruits. You might tell, “Alright, sure.” But then you buy whole fruits and you’ll run into a different problem. 

In theory eating a whole orange should be equivalent to drinking the orange juice. But it’s not like that cause the whole fruits has way less calories than the orange juice. Let assume the whole orange is 30 calories. So you would need around 4 oranges to make up for a glass of orange juice. 

I’m talking about orange juice but this applies to many other foods. For instance, a ready made salad is only 30 calories. Many health advocates will tell you that salads are the healthiest and you should be eating salads. If you eat two salads a day that’s only 60 calories. 

Any way, you guys get the idea.

One that I see recommended all the time is Optimum Nutrition 100% gold standard whey and I have a few questions/concerns about it.

Firstly, it isn't just whey isolate or concentrate, it mentions a 'protein blend' (""WHEY Protein Isolate, WHEY Protein Concentrate, Hydrolysed WHEY Protein Isolate"") which is already a red flag since you don't know which proportion they put the powders in so they could've just had the bulk of the product's volume made of the cheap stuff. Secondly, I've heard things about avoiding Soy products (like the soy lecithin emulsifier in this one) as it messes with male oestrogen. Finally there's stuff like Sucralose and Xanthan gum etc. Most other brands also follow a similar set of ingredients.

The point of this isn't to rant about Optimum Nutrition's protein powder or anything, but I was hoping someone could educate me on what's actually good and bad since I do try to be mindful about artificial products in my food and I don't want to mess up all those efforts by chugging down some protein powder every day. After all, there's still people out there that think that chemically riddled energy drinks and 'diet' soft drinks are fine for you to have on a regular basis.

Abstract: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and progressive autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), with both genetic and environmental factors contributing to the pathobiology of the disease. Although HLA genes have emerged as the strongest genetic factor linked to MS, consensus on the environmental risk factors is lacking. Recently, the gut microbiota has garnered increasing attention as a potential environmental factor in MS, as mounting evidence suggests that individuals with MS exhibit microbial dysbiosis (changes in the gut microbiome). Thus, there has been a strong emphasis on understanding the role of the gut microbiome in the pathobiology of MS, specifically, factors regulating the gut microbiota and the mechanism(s) through which gut microbes may contribute to MS. Among all factors, diet has emerged to have the strongest influence on the composition and function of gut microbiota. As MS patients lack gut bacteria capable of metabolizing dietary phytoestrogen, we will specifically discuss the role of a phytoestrogen diet and phytoestrogen metabolizing gut bacteria in the pathobiology of MS. A better understanding of these mechanisms will help to harness the enormous potential of the gut microbiota as potential therapeutics to treat MS and other autoimmune diseases.

The Chinese for instance have been eating white rice since like 8000 BC. 


Italians have been eating pasta since like the 13th century. 

We’ve been eating bread since like 10,000-14000 years ago. 

Yes I understand the processing part of the food like refined sugar and white bread but I’m not even talking about that. I’m talking about pasta and rice and non processed bread.

These people didn’t have all the selection of food like we do now where they can do “keto diet” because eating animal products were expensive or hard to get back then so carbs were their main source of food.

You even read in the Bible about how Jesus is the bread of life or the Lord’s Prayer where it’s “give us our daily bread”. Not bringing the Bible for religious reasons. Just saying that back then that’s how important bread was to people and their daily survival. So much so that they used Jesus to symbolize that.

Or are thighs really that much fattier than wings?"

Example meal 1:
4 pieces of bread, 2 pieces of cheese, Mayo, 1 pound ground beef with 1/4 tsp sodium

A meal like this which is basically just 2 average half pound hamburgers is easily 4000mg of sodium depending on what bread you use and how much sodium you add to the ground beef (the standard is 1/2-1tsp salt per pound) this might be a medium to large dinner for a lot of men.

Example meal 2:

3 hot dogs 3 hot dog buns mustard and ketchup with cheese

Another meal easily 3000-4000 mg sodium depending on the bread. This would be a very light meal or a snack to some.

These are 2 innocent meals you might see at the stereotypical American bbq where kids and adults would all have easily over 5000mg sodium per serving not even taking into account the other 2 meals of the day.

3400mg is supposedly the average but nearly any small meal you make is exceeding this without adding sodium if you eat processed foods and bread.

I would venture to assume that many overweight Americans are actually consuming an average of 7000-10000mg sodium a day.

The saturated fats in lard are palmitic acid (25-28%) and stearic acid (12-14%). Stearic acid is proved not to raise cholesterol levels, so only 25-28% of lard may be problemagic for your heart.

As opposed to seed oils, lard is not overly processed and refined,  does not go through chemical processes and in my opinion is less likely to oxidize, tho I have not looked up my last point I may be wrong there.

I just want to be clear, I do believe that certain saturated fats are worse than unsaturated fats and raise cholesterol levels but when it's only a quorter, it's not nearly as bad as some other saturated fats, it is unrefined and this little amount of bad acids do not worth the amount of stress some put in people for consuming lard.

I think my negative impression of margarine probably came from a time in which it had a lot of trans fats - now that this isn't the case, is margarine strictly better nutritionally speaking?  Is there some other kind of processing that makes margarine not worth recommending?

This is the video in question. in the ingredients it says 1.5lb of chicken is 660 calories.

Well I know that 1 gram of chicken breast has 1.65 calories. So I converted ounces to grams. 1 ounce is 28.3495 grams. We can just say 28.35g.

So 28.35g x 24 (ounces in 1.5lb) = 680
now I know that the recipe calls for 680grams of chicken
and 680 x 1.65 (calories per gram) comes out to 1,122 which is way more than the recipe said the chicken would be. So I double checked and did the math but kept it in ounces

My package of chicken says 140 cal per 4 ounces. 140 / 4 = 35
so its 35cal per ounce of chicken breast.

so simply 35cal x 24 ounces = 840cal.

Let's say we have the same person in two different scenarios: in the first one this person is in a high calories intake and is gaining weight, he never drinks alcohol so calories are given just by food and non-alcoholic drinks. In the second scenario, the person drinks a significant amount of alcohol, let's say half liter of beer per day, but keeping the same overall calories intake of the 1 scenario and also the same amount of protein, (thus less fat and carbs).  Who is going to have a better-looking physique of the two? Are they going to be exactly the same or not?

Now let's add the workout factor: in the first scenario the person trains regulary (muscle training), has a high calories intake that makes him gain weight but doesn't drink alcohol. In the second case, the same person also trains regulary, drinks one beer per day but still keeps the same calories and protein intake. Third scenario: the person does workout, doesn't drink, has the same high calories intake but eats half of the proteins of the two first cases, thus eats more fats and carbs. So who is going to gain more muscles of the three? Who is going to have the better muscle/fat ratio?

I recently watched a video about making a filling high calorie shelf stable ration and I had a few questions. The recipe consists of 1 part fat (lard, butter, coconut oil), 2 parts flour (any), 1 part oatmeal along with 1 part raisins.

2023-08-26 21:32:25,GSTP-1 gene and harmful Vitamin E supplementation,"Hey all,

First time posting here! I have heard here on Reddit that those with either the AG or AA genotype of the GSTP-1 gene should avoid any and all supplemental vitamin E. This recommendation doesn’t make a lot of sense and isn’t exactly what the data reflects, so I’d like to see what you all think about this interesting topic!

This recommendation mainly comes from [this](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916523028083?via%3Dihub) study where two groups of people consumed either 75IU of alpha-tocopherol or 600IU, for six weeks time. Baseline measures of various cytokines were taken, including IL-6. Baseline IL-6 was determined to be 15.35ng/ml in the 75IU group and 13.83ng/ml in the 600IU group. After six weeks, those with the AA or AG genotype of the GSTP-1 gene both had their IL-6 levels increase by just under 4ng/ml, while the GG genotype had their levels decrease by just under 2ng/ml.

Now to interpret this data. Most people have the AA genotype, then AG, and a small portion of the population are GG. So does this mean that most people shouldn’t be consuming supplemental vitamin E? The lowest dose used in the study was 75IU, which is much higher than the RDA of 22IU for vitamin E. But at the same time, there was no difference in IL-6 rise between the 75IU group and 600IU group, so who’s to say that a lower dose wouldn’t elicit this same response? Is the amount of alpha-tocopherol in a multivitamin even too much?

What do you guys think about this? I think it’s super interesting but I’m a little confused what the real world implication is supposed to be. I’m no expert, feel free to read the study yourselves!

I understand that eliminating alcohol is the healthiest option, but as someone who still wants to enjoy a drunken night out every now and again, I was looking at some supplements that will reduce some of the harmful effects of drinking alcohol, and potentially reduce hangover effects as well. I know there is not way to eliminate all negative effects of alcohol, but my thought is if I can take something to at least offset some of them, I might as well!

  
I did some research on these supplements and am thinking of the following: 

  
Glutathione before and after  
NAC before  
Vitamin C before and after  
Vitamin B1 before, during and after

  
Also:   
Zinc/Magnesium before bed  
Coconut water before bed and morning after

  
My concern is that a lot of these supplements may do the same thing (basically antioxidants/reduce the effects/regulate the eliminate of acetaldehyde). Is having all the supplements overkill or potentially dangerous? Would it be best to take just one or too?

  
Does anyone have any advice or experience with these supplements? Am I on the right path? Should I remove or add anything?

  
Thanks!

2023-08-11 13:39:27,"Does the fermentation period in yeast bread/pizza dough truly have an impact on digestibility, or is it just a myth? - A study","Hi everyone,

Most pizza enthusiasts (or bread for that matter) have probably heard at some point that ""the longer a dough ferments, the better its digestibility is"". Obviously, the breakdown of proteins into peptides/amino acids and starch into simple sugars does ""reduce"" some of the work for our digestive system; But is this effect significant enough to conclude that, say, a 72-hour dough will necessarily feel ""lighter"" to the average person, than a 2-hour dough? Personally, I've made plenty of both (24+ vs 2 hours), and I have never noticed any significant difference, nor have those who ate my pizzas.

I came across a very recent study (June '23) focused on the digestibility of pizza (I believe this is the first study I've encountered that specifically focuses on PIZZA rather than bread or other aspects of bread making). In short, the study examined several metrics including acids, simple sugars and proteins, to determine whether there is an impact on the digestibility and health benefits of different doughs.  
The study can be found here: [https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15132958](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15132958)

6 doughs were tested: 3 doughs were made with 100% biga; the biga was fermented for 24, 48, and 72 hours, and then incorporated into the final dough, which was fermented for an additional 3.5 hours. Two doughs contained sourdough, one in the biga (48-hour fermentation with 5% sourdough of the total dough weight, not baker's percentages), and one in the final dough (19% of the total dough weight).The last dough was a control dough, fermented for 3.5 hours without biga or sourdough.   
My focus for this matter is on the doughs without the sourdough (long fermented vs short fermented).

The results indicate some advantages (on paper) for the longer-fermented doughs, with slightly higher levels of simple sugars, higher acidity (TTA), a slightly lower glycemic index, and small differences in some other metrics (peptides, dietary fibers, resistant starch, EAA index, BV index, PER, NI).Here is a summary of the results for each dough:

1st dough (3.5 hours fermentation): pH: 5.6, TTA: 2.3, Phytic acid: 0.12, IPVD: 62.2, pGI: 71.3, EAA index: 75.85, BV index: 70.98, PER: 19.19, NI: 2.77, Lactic acid: 2.6, Glucose: 3.1, Fructose: 6.9, Maltose: 74.7, Peptides: 9.1, Resistance starch: 1, Dietary fibers: 14.2

2nd dough (48 hours fermentation) pH: 5.48, TTA: 3.3, Phytic acid: 0.11, IPVD: 63, pGI: 67.8, EAA index: 68.99, BV index: 63.5, PER: 24.69, NI: 2.86, Lactic acid: 2.5, Glucose: 10, Fructose: 5.8, Maltose: 35.4, Peptides: 9.5, Resistance starch: 1.1, Dietary fibers: 14.4

3rd dough (72 hours fermentation) pH: 5.41, TTA: 3.1, Phytic acid: 0.11, IPVD: 62.7, pGI: 68.5, EAA index: 75.26, BV index: 70.33, PER: 24.37, NI: 3.6, Lactic acid: 2.3, Glucose: 21.1, Fructose: 14, Maltose: 61, Peptides: 11.4, Resistance starch: 0.8, Dietary fibers: 13.7

I am not a nutritionist, but to the best of my knowledge, these findings imply that in terms of overall ""health benefits"" and dough digestibility, any distinctions among the doughs in practical circumstances (i.e. real life) would likely be minimal or even non-existent. It would be extremely valuable if an expert in this field could analyze the results. I am well aware that each person's endogenous digestive system works differently, and that there can't be a definitive answer to this question; what I'm trying to figure out is whether for the average person, the objective results of the above study suggest that in real life, there should (or shouldn't) be a notable difference in terms of digestibility between the different doughs.

This costs barely anything more than regular milk.

* High protein milk: **1.6 cents per gram.**
* Whey protein: **3 cents per gram** (when purchasing the cheapest 5kg bag).

So my question is: what's the catch? I'm coming at this from a fitness and muscle building perspective. I'm thinking whey is higher in BCAA's plus lower in sugars. Other than that, I feel like I just found a cheat for super cheap protein supplementation.

However, I don't get it... Can someone explain to me from where is this coming? 

For example, eating fish, which is fatty, I find completely acceptable. However, eating a toast and spreading a huge layer of pure butter on it or drenching stuff in tallow/lard and saying it's super healthy because you need fat, I don't get it...

What purpose of high fat consumption serves apart from providing you a lot of concentrated energy?"

I weigh 180lbs so that would mean i would have to eat 4 meals a day evenly split and theoretically would not allow me to make up for any opportunities i missed throughout the day as anything above 30ish grams is not used to help build muscle.

i know this protein goes somewhere and is used for other things like energy, but i guess why do we need it to help build muscle if so much isnt used for actual MPS?

After a few years of not eating meat, I plan on adding salmon back this week. My question is, what is your opinion on where the best salmon/seafood come from? Of course I hear about Alaskan salmon, but I wonder where the best of stuff is from whether it's food, water, whatever that may be less talked about. One of my friends said salmon from Norway is better.

One of my options is from Whole Foods, who is partners with the Marine Stewardship Council (don't really know anything about them yet), which has salmon from Alaska and Norway. I'd also buy online, but can't afford very expensive food. Somebody told me about Vital Choice awhile ago, but it's too expensive for me.

Since it'd be my first time eating it in a long time, I'd like it being of higher quality (I'd always want it to be, but even more so in this instance).

A girl from Yakutsk in this video starting at 12:51 mentions the whitefish she's holding and it coming from ecologically pure places really far from civilization:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFirUsS8pDQ&t=414s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFirUsS8pDQ&t=414s)

I don't expect to able to get fish from anywhere in the world sent to my house or local store, but I would like to know the best.

I'm also interested in other seafood that is safe to eat, so I'm interested in those suggestions too, such as for cod.

Any help would be appreciated.

I'm curious to find the best way to calculate how expensive different foods are compared to each other, to find a meaningful way to eat on a budget. The problem is of course assigning values on a one-dimensional scale to foods for comparison.

2023-08-02 19:50:55,Robust Scientific Sources Showing Harms of Substantial Whey Protein Intake,"Hi Everyone!  
I am looking for solid peer reviewed articles which show negative health effects of substantial whey protein intake on a regular basis e.g., 120-180g protein per day. My understanding, per the [Examine Optimal Protein Guide](https://examine.com/guides/protein-intake/), as well as a variety of other sources, is that whey generally has superior bioavailability and amino acid profile compared to nearly all other protein sources (excluding casein).

I have been unable to find what I consider to be robust data showing negative effects of high consumption, so I am looking to see if anyone has any available (my goal is to not argue but to see if there is research showing I am putting myself at gratuitous risk).

For further context, the meta analysis I have been able to find is [Whey protein supplementation and its potentially adverse effects on health: a systematic review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32702243/). This article is a reference, and often the sole reference, in nearly every non-peer-reviewed article I have read as well e.g., [The Harmful Side Effects of Whey Protein](https://nutritionstudies.org/the-harmful-side-effects-of-whey-protein/).

The issue is that a substantial number of issues with this research paper were called out in what I considered to be a very robust review by Dr. Caio Eduardo Goncalves Reis, [Discussion of ""Whey protein supplementation and its potentially adverse effects on health: a systematic review""--Unsubstantiated claims of adverse effects of whey protein supplementation on human kidney and liver function](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA648262638&sid=googleScholar&v=2.1&it=r&linkaccess=abs&issn=17155312&p=HRCA&sw=w&userGroupName=nysl_oweb&aty=ip).  
Given this, I would be immensely appreciative if either:

* Someone with a medical/physiology/nutrition background could explain why Dr. Reis' rebuttal is incorrect (only if you believe it to be true, not just for the sake of argument), or:
* Alternate peer reviewed research could be provided showing negative effects of significant whey protein supplementation, preferably in humans.

Even if it is essential, it makes no sense that it's added in the form of retinol rather than beta-carotene, as the latter can be regulated into the conversion of retinol and at worst causes mild coloring changes while retinol overdose = blindness + hair loss + dry skin + all sorts of epithelium changes.",nutrition,"Retinol addition in all types of foods-Is anyone concerned about the addition of retinol in all types of foods in the USA?

I'm specifically interested in finding podcasts or YouTube channels that offer intermediate-level nutrition lectures. I'm looking for content that delves deeper into advanced concepts. I'm all ears!

2023-07-19 04:31:14,Plain oatmeal vs packets?,"I'm truly stumped right now. This doesnt make any sense and I feel like I'm missing something. On bodybuilding forums in the past I've always seen it generally encouraged and pushed not to eat flavoured oatmeal packets and instead eat plain oats. I've seen it said it was higher value and that you get a lot more food and energy for less sugar/calories.

But I'm looking at the calories and macros on the flavoured packets vs the plain instant oatmeal and the calorie amount looks about the same. The sugar/fat amounts are as well and this is for about the same amount of food too (30g)

So is there really any reason to avoid these flavoured oatmeal packets if I'm trying to stay lean? People say they are higher calorie/sugar but I'm not seeing that at all. I got the Quakers instant oatmeal lower sugar variety pack and the Quaker instant oatmeal fruit and cream variety pack (not specified as lower sugar) to compare with the recommended plain instant oats container. Is there a significant difference I'm not seeing? 

Cause I'd rather have the packets over the container if its going to have the same effect on my body.

This may come as no surprise, yet you have far more control over how it affects your rest and recuperation. Caffeine reduces overall sleep time by 45 minutes on average.

Based on an analysis of 24 studies, the researchers presented some useful tips for selecting when to consume your final cup of coffee. They discovered:  
  
Caffeine in the amount of 47 mg (half a cup of coffee) is unlikely to impact overall sleep time.  
  
To avoid sleep problems, 107 mg (about 1 cup of coffee) should be consumed at least 9 hours before bedtime.
